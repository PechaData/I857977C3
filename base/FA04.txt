From the <Gongpa Rabsel>, Sixth Mind Generation, verses 1-64
Second, there are four parts to explaining the sixth ground called "The Manifest": defining what this ground means and showing how perfect wisdom is superior here, praising the perfection of wisdom, explaining true reality through understanding deep dependent origination, and concluding by describing the qualities of this ground.
First, when a bodhisattva masters perfect meditation on the fifth level of development, they advance to the sixth level. Here, they achieve an outstanding state of mental focus. This allows them to understand the deep truth about how everything is connected through causes and conditions. Because they now excel in perfect wisdom, they can reach a state of complete peace. This wasn't possible before, on the fifth level or earlier, because their wisdom wasn't yet advanced enough. Just being good at generosity and the other four perfections isn't enough to reach this state.
Because they have gained superior wisdom that allows them to directly see how all phenomena are like reflections, and because they focus on the truth of the path at the fifth ground, and because they are moving directly toward gaining the qualities of a fully enlightened buddha, this ground is called "The Manifest."
According to the Commentary, the second reason refers to realizing the path where mind and objects are not perceived. However, since the fifth ground focuses on the path truth (the last of the four truths), one masters both coarse and subtle aspects of the four truths there. This means that wisdom skilled in the four truths becomes perfect on the sixth ground. The first reason shows how the training in wisdom that understands forward and reverse dependent origination becomes perfect. Together, these two perfected wisdom trainings lead to direct realization of the truths and dependent origination.
When you reach this ground, as your wisdom training becomes complete, your meditation becomes deeper and your insight grows proportionally stronger. Since you already mastered concentration meditation on the fifth ground, your wisdom reaches its peak here. This is where you first achieve the special state of complete cessation.
From the Precious Garland: "The sixth level is called 'Directly Facing' because the practitioner directly faces the Buddha's teachings. By practicing calm meditation and insight meditation together, one grows through reaching the state of cessation. As a result of this practice, one is reborn as Sunirmita, the king of gods. Since even the disciples cannot outshine him, he helps calm those who are overly proud." Note: Sunirmita is also known as the lord of the Heaven of Delight in Emanations.
Second, let's look at how the perfection of wisdom guides other practices like generosity. Think of a person with good eyesight leading a group of blind people to where they want to go. Similarly, the perfection of wisdom takes all the other good qualities like generosity, which can't see the true nature of reality, and leads them to the state of enlightenment. This works because the perfection of wisdom can clearly see which paths are correct and which aren't.
From the teachings, we find this in the Noble Condensed Sutra: Imagine billions of blind people without anyone to guide them - they don't even know which way to go, so how could they possibly find their way into a city? Similarly, without wisdom to guide them, the other five perfections are like blind people - they'll never reach enlightenment. The Diamond Cutter adds another example: When someone with good eyesight walks into complete darkness, they can't see anything - that's like a bodhisattva who gives gifts while still believing things exist independently. But when dawn comes and the sun rises, that same person can see everything clearly - that's like a bodhisattva who gives gifts without getting caught up in believing things truly exist. This same principle applies to moral discipline and all other practices.
The third section contains five parts: First, making a commitment to explain the deep meaning. Second, identifying who is ready to receive this deep teaching. Third, describing the benefits that come from teaching it to prepared students. Fourth, encouraging qualified people to listen. Fifth, explaining how to teach the true nature of dependent origination.
Someone asks: "How did a bodhisattva on the sixth level see the true nature of cause and effect when they understood dependent origination?" The <Commentary> explains that we can't really understand this because our minds are clouded by ignorance - it's like having cataracts covering our eyes. Only those who have reached the sixth level and beyond can truly understand this. So we shouldn't be the ones trying to explain it. Instead, we should ask the buddhas and advanced bodhisattvas, who have cleared away the clouds of ignorance with their perfect understanding of emptiness.
If someone asks about directly experiencing ultimate reality, the Teacher says to ask those who have done so. It's like putting medicine in your eyes - it makes your vision clearer but doesn't remove your eyes. Similarly, when you understand that seeing emptiness is like eye medicine that makes your mind's eye clearer without removing your wisdom eye, you won't fall into the wrong view that claims there's no wisdom in the noble ones' meditation. Someone might object: "Don't the Mother Sutras and the Ten Grounds Sutra teach that bodhisattvas practicing wisdom see the true nature of dependent origination? So explain it according to these texts!" But since it's hard to be sure what the scriptures really mean, even I can't teach ultimate reality based just on scripture.
This explanation is given independently. When we see that authoritative treatises about reality were written by trustworthy authors who correctly explain scripture, we can understand scripture's true meaning. Just like a sixth-level bodhisattva understands the deepest teachings, Nāgārjuna correctly understood the scriptures. In his Madhyamaka works, he clearly explained reality using both scripture quotes and logical reasoning. Therefore, Candrakīrti will explain reality exactly as taught in Nāgārjuna's system.
Someone asked how <Nagarjuna> could understand the true meaning of Buddhist teachings without any mistakes. The answer can be found in the scriptures. The <Lankavatara Sutra> tells us that in the southern land of <Vedi>, there would be a famous and respected monk named <Naga>. This monk would show why both extreme views - that things exist and that things don't exist - are wrong. He would teach the highest form of Buddhism to the world. After reaching a high spiritual level called the "Ground of Joy," he would then go to the Pure Land of <Sukhavati>. This is how we know <Nagarjuna> would explain Buddhism's true meaning, which avoids these two extreme views.
This comes from the Sublime Golden Light. During the time when the Teacher was alive, there was a Licchavi youth called "Delightful to See for All Worlds." The Great Cloud tells us that this same person would be reborn as a monk named Naga 400 years after the Teacher's passing into nirvana. This monk would spread the teaching widely. Eventually, he would become a buddha named "Light Source of Wisdom" in a realm called "Utterly Pure Light." This proves that there is definitive scriptural certainty about this person.
According to the Root Tantra of Manjushri, similar details are given about when he would appear and what his name would be, saying he would live for 600 years. The Great Drum Sutra tells us that a young man named Priyadarshana from the Licchavi clan would become a monk when Buddhism was declining, 80 years after the Buddha passed away. This monk would use the Buddha's name and help Buddhism grow again. After living for 100 years, he died and was reborn in Sukhavati. Both Elder Bhadra and the great teacher Atisha believed this prophecy was about the same master, saying that Priyadarshana and Nagarjuna were the same person. The Great Drum Sutra says this monk reached the seventh level of enlightenment. These different accounts don't necessarily conflict with each other, just like how some texts describe certain great kings as beginning practitioners while others describe them as fully enlightened buddhas.
Second point: Definitive treatises should only be studied by people who have previously trained their minds and have developed some understanding of emptiness. Others should not study these texts because even if they listen to teachings about emptiness, their wrong understanding will lead to serious harm.
Here's how serious harm can happen: Sometimes people who don't know better give up on emptiness and end up in lower realms. Other times, they misunderstand emptiness (the lack of inherent existence) by thinking "nothing exists at all." First they develop the wrong view that denies cause and effect, then they stick to this view and make it grow stronger and stronger.
The text discusses a famous verse about emptiness that warns how misunderstanding it can harm people with limited wisdom, just like incorrectly handling a snake or performing a ritual wrong. In the text called "Clear Words," it explains that we need to balance two things: we shouldn't deny that everyday cause and effect exist (like reflections in a mirror), but we also shouldn't think things have permanent, real existence. If we go against either of these principles, we fall into extreme views of either "nothing exists" or "everything exists permanently." While there might be slight differences in how we say "non-existent" versus "not existing," when we really think about what these terms mean, there's no real difference between them.
The <Catuḥśataka> says that one person goes to lower realms alone while another goes to an extraordinary peace. Commenting on this, it explains that both actually go to lower realms - those who are not spiritually mature who hear teachings about selflessness will go to lower realms either by rejecting it or misunderstanding it. Misunderstanding here means taking emptiness to mean complete non-existence. Therefore, when people lack the mental capacity to grasp such subtle concepts but proudly think they understand, and show apparent strong devotion to profound teachings beyond their ability, this leads to great harm. We must be very careful about this. How should emptiness be taught to such people?
If someone asks how we can tell whether a person should or shouldn't be taught emptiness, there are clear external signs to look for. When beginners first hear correct teachings about emptiness, they immediately feel deep joy that keeps arising within them. This joy makes tears come to their eyes and gives them goosebumps. When you see these signs, it means that person has the seed of enlightened wisdom - specifically the seed for understanding emptiness. Such a person is ready to receive teachings on ultimate truth from a qualified master, and they should be taught the ultimate truth (which will be explained in detail later).
When someone hears a correct teaching about emptiness and actually understands it, certain physical signs will appear - these are unmistakable indicators. If someone either doesn't understand the teaching or understands it but doesn't show these signs, we can't be sure yet if they're ready for deep teachings. However, if they follow their holy lama's instructions carefully, they can become someone who can develop many capabilities for understanding emptiness.
Third point: When we teach emptiness to someone who is properly prepared to listen, it won't be a waste of time. Why? Because not only will they avoid the problems that come from misunderstanding emptiness, but they'll also gain all the good qualities that naturally come from understanding emptiness correctly.
How does this happen? When someone is ready to learn about emptiness, they treat it like finding a precious treasure. They want to make sure they don't lose this understanding in their future lives, so they commit to following good moral rules. They think, "If I break these rules and end up in a bad rebirth, I'll lose my understanding of emptiness." That's why they take these moral rules seriously and stick to them. You don't need to formally take moral vows to break them - just doing naturally wrong things is already breaking moral discipline. They also think, "Even if I follow the rules and get a good rebirth, if I'm too poor to afford basic needs like food, medicine, and clothes, I'll be so busy trying to survive that I won't have time to study emptiness or meditate on it." So they practice giving to both spiritual and ordinary people, as mentioned before.
They think: "Only when the view of emptiness is combined with great compassion as explained before will it lead to buddhahood, not otherwise." So they practice developing great compassion as the foundation. They also think: "Anger leads to lower rebirths, destroys good deeds, and makes one look very ugly. The noble ones won't be pleased with these effects." So they practice patience. They understand that if good actions like following moral rules aren't repeatedly dedicated to achieving complete wisdom, they won't lead to buddhahood or create an endless flow of good results like having a good body and enjoyments. So they dedicate all their virtuous actions to awakening to free all beings from the cycle of existence.
When you see that others besides bodhisattvas, like hearers and solitary realizers, can't teach deep dependent origination the way bodhisattvas can, you develop deep respect for bodhisattvas who seek perfect enlightenment. When Mahayana practitioners truly understand emptiness, they develop the pure understanding mentioned before and become deeply devoted to practicing the vast aspects of the path. This is highly praiseworthy. As the <Bodhicittavivarana> says: "Understanding that things are empty while accepting karma and its results is more amazing than amazing, more wonderful than wonderful!" This happens when you avoid two mistakes: either rejecting the teachings from lack of faith, or seeming to accept them while wrongly thinking that reasoning denies all cause and effect. Instead, you should understand that the view of emptiness as lack of inherent existence makes all actions and their effects even more logical.
If you don't understand it correctly, when you claim to have found the true view, you'll end up treating all teachings about karma and ethics as meaningless - like trying to count wrinkles on a non-existent rabbit's horn. You might think these teachings are only for those who haven't understood the ultimate truth, while those who have understood don't need them. By believing that everything is just mental concepts and all thinking is attachment to true existence, you'll end up like Hwa shang from China, destroying all virtuous practices.
Some people argue that we should temporarily follow rules of right and wrong from our confused perspective. But this creates problems. If we say some thoughts are based on believing things truly exist while others aren't, then using logic that disproves true existence would invalidate everything - which makes no sense. If we don't make this distinction, then our understanding of emptiness and our ethical conduct will conflict like hot and cold. Plus, we can't even establish the confused perspective itself, who's confused, or what they're confused about, since there's no basis for any of it. This whole argument is just creating confusion in the dark. We should stick to what the earlier texts taught.
Fourth point: If you are skilled in both deep and vast Buddhist practices, you should continuously gather positive karma in both these aspects while still an ordinary person. By doing this over a long time, you will gradually reach the Ground of Perfect Joy. So if you want to reach this state, you should listen carefully to the profound path that will be explained next.
As explained in the Commentary on the Four Hundred Verses: If someone becomes respectful of teachings about emptiness, we should help increase their faith in emptiness by creating the right conditions. They should develop great compassion, be grateful to the Buddha, and want to give up anything that might block their path to the Dharma - especially dangerous pitfalls. They should face their fears, give even what's hard to give up, and gather others using the four ways of bringing people together. We should teach this precious Dharma carefully to those who are ready to receive it. This means we need to make a big effort to teach, but only to those who don't have the two problems that make someone unsuitable. Even when teaching those who have faith but don't fully understand, we should use methods that don't damage their understanding of dependent origination.
When a knowledgeable teacher explains the Dharma to qualified students, even those with minimal capacity, it creates enormous merit. The <Sutrasamuccaya> tells us that having faith in the deep teachings brings all possible merit. Until you become a buddha, you'll achieve all possible accomplishments, both in this world and beyond. The <Ratnadatta-kumara-sutra> explains it this way: "<Manjushri>, if someone just listens to these teachings with doubt, they create more merit than a bodhisattva who lacks skillful means and practices the six perfections for hundreds of thousands of years. Imagine how much more merit comes from listening without doubt! And even more from writing it down, reading it aloud, keeping it, and teaching it widely to others!"
From the Diamond Cutter Sutra: The Buddha asked, "Subhuti, what do you think? If there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in one Ganges river, would all the sand grains in those rivers be a huge number?" Subhuti answered, "Lord, just that many Ganges rivers would already be a huge number, not to mention all their sand grains!" The Buddha then said, "Listen carefully, Subhuti. If someone were to fill that many world systems with seven kinds of precious jewels and offer them to the Buddha, would they gain a lot of merit?" Subhuti replied, "Yes Lord, they would gain an enormous amount of merit."
The Buddha said that anyone who remembers even a four-line verse from this teaching and shares it with others will create much more merit. The <Tathagata Treasury Sutra> teaches that even someone who has committed the ten major wrongdoings, if they understand selflessness and believe that all things are naturally pure, won't be reborn in lower realms. The chapter on <Subduing Mara> says that when monks understand that all things are naturally at peace and that faults have no real beginning, and when they let go of guilt without dwelling on their mistakes, they can overcome even the worst actions, not to mention minor rule-breaking. The <Ajatashatru Sutra> states that when someone who has done terrible things hears this teaching and accepts it with faith, their actions won't block their spiritual progress. These are the benefits of teaching, listening to, believing in, and thinking about these deep teachings.
To properly benefit from teaching, you need two things: First, you must have pure motivation and not be seeking personal gain, respect, or fame. Second, you must explain the teaching correctly without misinterpreting its meaning. Teaching with either or both of these faults will block the accumulation of great merit. As Master Vasubandhu said: "Those who teach the Dharma incorrectly or teach with a mind corrupted by desire for gain, respect and fame are diminishing their own great merit." This applies here too. Listeners also need pure motivation and correct understanding, so both teachers and students should meet at least these basic requirements when teaching and learning. The fifth section has three parts: showing how scripture teaches the true meaning, proving the scriptural meaning through reasoning, and explaining the types of emptiness established by this. The first part has two sections: presenting scriptural teachings and identifying what prevents understanding of suchness.
First, according to the Ten Grounds Sutra, when a bodhisattva on the fifth ground enters the sixth ground, they do so through ten types of equality of phenomena. What are these ten? They are: all phenomena being equal in lacking characteristics, all phenomena being equal in lacking defining features, and similarly - being unborn, not arising, being empty, being naturally pure, being free from elaboration, being free from accepting or rejecting. Also, all phenomena being equal in being like illusions, dreams, mirages, echoes, moon reflections in water, mirror images and magical creations, and all phenomena being equal in lacking the duality of existence and non-existence. When one realizes the nature of all phenomena in this way, through sharp and compatible patience, one attains the sixth bodhisattva ground called The Manifest. The phrase "similarly" applies "all phenomena" up through "being free from accepting or rejecting." The first two make one equality, the seven similes make another equality, and the last two make one equality. The identification of these ten equalities differs between the Ten Grounds Sutra Commentary and the Bodhisattva Levels text. Since their way of explaining emptiness differs from this system, it's explained differently here. The first equality means that all phenomena appearing with different characteristics are equal in not existing from the perspective of noble ones' meditation.
The second point explains how all things are equal in that they lack self-defining characteristics. This and the previous point give us a general overview. The next eight points break this general idea down into specifics. For example, "no arising" relates to the future, while "unborn" relates to other time periods. This equality applies to all phenomena. "Emptiness" means being empty of both what will arise and what has already arisen. This emptiness isn't created by scriptures or logic - it's naturally pure from the beginning. This is the sixth point. The seventh point talks about being free from dualistic appearances, while the eighth follows a similar pattern. The ninth point provides many examples to prove these ideas. The tenth point shows how all things are equal in lacking both existence and non-existence. "Sharp" means quick understanding, and "compatible" refers to accepting the non-arising nature of things at the eighth level of realization. While many texts explain the true nature of things, this passage specifically discusses how wisdom works at the sixth level of realization.
When studying how things lack true existence, you need to clearly understand two things: what "true existence" means and how we normally grasp things as truly existing. Without this understanding, you'll misunderstand emptiness. As <Shantideva> says in the <Bodhicaryavatara>: "If you don't understand what you're trying to disprove, you won't understand its absence." This means that if you can't clearly see in your mind what you're trying to negate, you won't properly understand its non-existence. This applies especially to our natural tendency to see things as truly existing - a habit we've had since beginningless time. This innate grasping is present in everyone, whether they've studied philosophy or not. It's not enough to just understand the philosophical theories about true existence. You must recognize this deep-seated habit in your own mind and use reasoning to gradually overcome it. Just arguing about it intellectually won't help much. The <Svatantrika> and <Prasangika> schools explain this differently, so we'll look at both approaches. The <Svatantrika> explanation has three parts: understanding true existence and our grasping at it, using the example of illusions to show what's true and false in everyday life, and applying this example to reality.
First, while other Svātantrika texts don't clearly explain what should be rejected in their philosophy, Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakaloka tells us that true existence is the opposite of conventional existence. The text explains that our confused mind sees things as truly existing when they actually don't. This confusion is called "conventional" because it hides the truth. As a sutra says, things only arise conventionally - they have no real nature. This confusion comes from habits we've had since beginningless time, making all beings see things as truly real when they aren't. Both our thinking mind and our senses are involved in this confusion, but the false way things appear to exist is only conventional, not ultimate truth.
Someone asks about a quote from <Snangba> that says "ultimately there is no arising." The text explains this means things aren't established by perfect knowledge. They wonder how this relates to things being established by rational understanding of reality. The answer is that we need to understand two different meanings of "ultimate." The first meaning refers to our rational understanding through study, thought, and meditation - in this sense, things aren't established as explained before. The second meaning refers to how things might exist independently of our minds. Things can exist in the first sense but not in the second. While the second type of existence requires the first type, believing in the first type isn't the same as our natural tendency to believe things truly exist. Many people got confused about this and made mistakes about whether ultimate truth exists or not. Understanding this helps us see why there's no contradiction between saying things don't ultimately exist while also saying ultimate reality does exist.
Second, to understand how things exist - both when they are created by our minds and when they aren't - we can look at the example of magic. When a magician makes horses and oxen appear from pebbles and sticks, there are three types of people watching: the magician, the audience whose eyes are tricked, and those whose eyes aren't tricked. The magician sees the horses and oxen but knows they aren't real. The tricked audience both sees them and believes they're real. The untricked audience neither sees nor believes in them. Just like when someone mistakes a rope for a snake, we must accept that the magical objects really do appear as horses and oxen - otherwise, how could anyone be fooled? The magician understands these appearances are created by confused minds, not by the actual pebbles and sticks. But the audience doesn't realize their minds are creating these appearances - they think real horses and oxen are standing right there in front of them.
This shows how we understand things - whether they exist just because our mind makes them exist, or whether they exist independently. When we see something, there are two possibilities: either it exists exactly as we see it, or it doesn't. Understanding this helps avoid confusion. Some might think "Since we know things through valid reasoning, and reasoning happens in our mind, then everything must exist only because our mind makes it exist. This would mean even realist philosophers would have to admit nothing truly exists." But this mixes up two different ideas. When we say valid reasoning establishes things, we mean it helps us understand how things really exist - which is completely different from saying our mind creates things.
According to the Yogācāra-Madhyamaka school, illusions are verified by self-aware direct perception. The Svātantrika school, which accepts external objects, says illusions are verified by direct sensory perception of things like ground or space. We can prove these appearances aren't real because if they were, people with healthy eyes would see them - but they don't. When we establish both the appearance and its emptiness together, ordinary people who aren't following any philosophical system naturally see it as false. This is why understanding that reflections are empty of what they appear to be isn't a matter of sophisticated philosophical reasoning. Even in everyday understanding, when something appears one way, it can't simultaneously be empty of that appearance, and vice versa. When both happen together, it's simply false from an ordinary perspective.
Third, imagine watching a magic show with eyes that have been tricked. That's how beings see things - both outer and inner - as truly real. They think these things exist on their own, not just because minds see them that way. This mistaken view has been with us forever. The <Svātantrika> school describes this differently from the <Prāsaṅgika> school - their version is too simple to capture the subtle way we naturally grasp at true existence. But when we use logic to show this view is wrong, we become like the magician who knows the truth. We stop thinking things exist independently and understand they only exist because our minds make them appear that way. However, just because our mind thinks something exists doesn't make it real - it has to stand up to logical analysis. For example, when a seed grows into a sprout, our mind sees this happening, but the sprout also grows by itself - like how a magician's props can look like horses and oxen on their own. This explains how everything exists in everyday life. Even the ultimate nature of reality exists this way - it's there because minds perceive it, making it part of conventional reality.
Just like a magical illusion might look like a horse or ox but isn't really one, things like pots appear to be pots but are actually empty of being pots. This isn't how we should understand the comparison between illusions and other things, because that would mean nothing could actually exist, and we'd only be talking about appearances rather than reality. When someone achieves non-conceptual wisdom in deep meditation, all dual appearances fade away - just like someone with clear vision doesn't see or believe in illusions. The <Svatantrika> tradition has its own special way of explaining this, which I'll briefly explain here since we won't cover their specific logical arguments later. They say everything we can know is either existent or non-existent. Looking at existent things first: These are either physical or non-physical. For physical things, they prove these must have parts (like east, west, etc.), and for consciousness, they show it must have temporal parts. After proving everything has parts, they show that the parts and the whole can't be completely different (or they wouldn't relate) but must be one entity.
When we examine something closely with our mind, we can see that while its true nature and essence are actually one thing, it appears to us as if they were different things. This is like an illusion - we need to understand both how things appear and how they are empty of that appearance. While this dual nature makes sense when we consider it as something that exists only in relation to our mind's perception, it would be completely illogical if we tried to claim it exists independently of our mind. Why? Because as previously explained, something that truly exists can't have a mismatch between how it appears and how it actually is. If something truly exists, it must be completely real without any falseness, and our perception of different essences would have to be correct - which would contradict the fact that they are actually one essence.
Once we establish this point, we can use the same reasoning to show that non-things also lack true existence. Take space, for example - it has to spread out over physical objects, with one part covering the east and other parts covering other directions. The same goes for ultimate reality - it has many parts that spread out, and different minds understand different parts of it at different times. Other unchanging things work the same way. Since the parts and the whole can't be different things, they must be the same thing. This works for false things but not for truly existing things. So, like before, this shows that nothing truly exists. This is what Śāntarakṣita and his followers taught. It's shortsighted to think this only applies to physical things. The kind of falseness that ordinary people understand isn't the same as what the Madhyamika philosophers mean. While things exist in people's minds, that's just how they appear to them - we don't accept that limited view.
In this way, while nothing exists independently of how it appears to our mind, this philosophical system accepts that things can exist in a way that depends on mental appearance without being mere labels. This creates an important difference in how the two Madhyamaka schools understand what they're trying to disprove. I've explained this here because I've seen that when people are first carefully guided through this system's understanding of truth and our attachment to truth, along with brief explanations of how these are disproven, and then later introduced to the Prasangika system, they can better understand the different philosophical views.
Second, if you understand how things exist just because we think about them in a certain way, you'll easily see how wrong it is to think things exist independently on their own. This topic has two parts: first, how things exist because of our thoughts about them, and second, how we mistakenly think things exist independently.
First, let's look at what the scriptures say. In the "Questions of Upali," it states that beautiful flowers of various kinds open their petals, and magnificent golden palaces shine brilliantly - yet no one actually makes these things. They exist only through the power of our thoughts. The world itself is examined through the power of thought. Many other texts also say that all things are just labels created by our thoughts. In "Sixty Reasonings," Buddha explains that since the world depends on ignorance, we can say it's just conceptual thinking. The "Four Hundred Verses" adds that without thought, things like desire wouldn't exist, so who would believe these things are both real and just thoughts? The commentary explains this using the example of a rope mistaken for a snake - things only exist when we think about them, and don't exist when we don't think about them.
Conception arises based on that. When the commentary talks about attachment and other emotions being like seeing a snake on a rope, this is just an example. It shows how all phenomena are created by our thoughts, just like mistaking a rope for a snake. When a rope's striped pattern and coiled shape looks snake-like in dim light, we might think "that's a snake." At that moment, neither the rope as a whole nor any of its parts can actually be called a snake - it's purely our mind making this connection. Similarly, when we think "I" while looking at the physical and mental parts that make us up, there's nothing in these parts - whether taken as a stream through time, as a collection in one moment, or as individual pieces - that can actually be called "I." This will be explained more later. So, since there's nothing in or separate from these parts that could be the "I," this sense of self is just created by our thoughts based on these parts - it doesn't exist independently.
This is also mentioned in the "Precious Garland." It says that a person isn't earth, water, fire, wind, space, or consciousness, and isn't all of these things combined either. So what kind of person could exist apart from these elements? When we talk about a "person" here, we mean an individual, a living being, the "I," or the self. When the text says "not earth" up through "not consciousness," it's rejecting the idea that a person is any one of the six elements that make up a living being. When it says "not all," it's rejecting the idea that a person is just the collection of these elements. The final line rejects the idea that a person is something completely separate from these elements. However, this doesn't mean we should deny that persons exist, nor should we say that the foundation consciousness and similar things are what makes a person. The Noble One agrees with this interpretation, just as the commentary's author explained it.
If you understand how a person is created by thoughts, you'll see all other things are created the same way. The <King of Meditations Sutra> says: "Just as you understand yourself, apply that understanding to everything." The noble <Condensed Perfection of Wisdom> says: "Understand all beings as you understand yourself, and understand all things as you understand all beings." The <Precious Garland> clearly states: "Since a person is made of six elements, it isn't truly real. Similarly, since each element is made of parts, none are truly real." This means a person is labeled based on six elements coming together, and each element is labeled based on its parts. Nothing can exist without parts and something to hold the parts, yet nothing can be different from its parts either. While pots are conceptually created like seeing a snake in a rope, pots and rope-snakes are completely different in terms of existence and function. Their conventional uses and validity are totally different.
Regarding how things work in our everyday world based on our concepts: Among those who wrote commentaries explaining Buddhist texts, three masters - <Buddhapālita>, <Śāntideva>, and <Candrakīrti> - have a special way of explaining the teachings of the noble <Nāgārjuna> and his spiritual son. This is actually the trickiest part of understanding the Middle Way view. As the <Precious Garland> explains: Physical things are just names, and even space is just a name. Without basic elements, how can physical things exist? So even names themselves don't truly exist. The same goes for feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness - they're like the elements and the self. This shows that the six elements have no self-nature. And another verse says: Besides what we label with words, what really exists or doesn't exist in the world? This means that ultimately, not even names exist, and in everyday life, things only exist as labels we create through language. When we understand this well, we see that all things depend on other things to exist, that because they depend on labels and causes they can't exist independently, that nothing has its own independent nature apart from what language and concepts create, and that when we say something exists, we're just using labels without analyzing too deeply what they refer to.
Second, when we grasp at things as existing independently of mere names and labels, we are experiencing innate grasping at true existence. This means seeing things as truly, ultimately, or genuinely existing with their own nature or characteristics. According to the Svātantrika Madhyamaka school, while nothing can truly exist in an absolute sense, things do have some conventional inherent existence. This view helps guide those who cannot yet grasp the subtlest understanding of reality. As explained in Aryadeva's Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, what we call "self" is anything thought to exist independently. When we realize this doesn't exist in persons, that's the selflessness of persons. When we realize it doesn't exist in things like eyes and other phenomena, that's the selflessness of phenomena. These two types of selflessness are distinguished by what they apply to, not by what they negate.
According to the root text and <Auto-commentary>, when we naturally think "I am," we're focusing on a self that depends on other factors, not on physical parts (aggregates). This self-focused view sees the "I" as truly real. As <Auto-commentary> explains, this view involves afflicted wisdom that works through thoughts of "I" and "mine." While we might naturally grasp at other people as independently existing, that's different from this innate self-view. When texts mention "operating through I and mine," they're not just talking about basic thoughts of self, but about seeing "I" and "mine" as independently real.
The innate view that grasps at "mine" takes "mine" itself as its object, not things like our eyes. When focusing on this object, it grasps at "mine" as something that exists through its own nature. You might wonder about what's said in the autocommentary where it mentions that thinking "this is mine" involves attachment to all things other than what we consider "I." This seems to say that grasping at "mine" means being attached to things like our eyes as "mine." However, this really means that while we see eyes and such as "mine," we then get attached to the idea of "mine" as truly real. It's not saying that eyes and such are examples of what "mine" is. If that were the case, there wouldn't be any difference between the view of the transitory collection and grasping at the inherent existence of phenomena.
The innate tendency to see things as having real existence focuses on physical forms and senses (like eyes and ears) - both our own and others' - as well as the environment around us. This grasping at both personal and phenomenal existence keeps us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. As <Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness> explains, Buddha taught that seeing things arising from causes and conditions as truly real is ignorance, which leads to the twelve links of dependent origination. To break free from this ignorance, we need to see that things are empty of the way we grasp at them. As <Praise to the Dharmadhatu> and <Four Hundred Stanzas> teach, when we truly understand that neither persons nor phenomena have inherent existence, the seeds of cyclic existence will cease, and all delusions will end through seeing dependent origination.
This passage discusses how delusion, one of the three poisons, is a form of afflicted ignorance. To overcome this ignorance, we need to understand how emptiness appears through dependent origination. As the Commentary explains, yogis must negate the self by understanding selflessness through examining what we grasp as "self." Just pulling your mind back from objects isn't enough - you need to actually refute what you think of as "self." When our mind engages with things, it can see them as truly existing, as not truly existing, or neutrally. Just because you're not thinking about self doesn't mean you understand selflessness - there are many other ways the mind can work. We need to look at how we grasp at a self in our own minds and see how that grasping is mistaken. Otherwise, we're like someone looking for a thief's footprints in a meadow when the thief has run into the forest. Once we really understand what it means to grasp at true existence, we'll see there are many thoughts that aren't about self-grasping at all. This helps us avoid thinking that we need to negate everything our mind thinks about.
The second section contains two parts: how to use reasoning to prove that phenomena have no self-nature, and how to use reasoning to prove that persons have no self-nature. The first of these has four parts: disproving production from four extremes in both conventional and ultimate truth, addressing objections to this disproof, explaining how dependent origination itself counters wrong views about extremes, and showing what we gain from reasoned analysis. The first of these has three parts: stating our position that nothing is produced inherently, presenting logical arguments to prove this, and explaining what we learn from disproving production from four extremes.
Regarding the first point: Among the ten types of equality that were explained earlier, <Nagarjuna> thought it would be easier to teach the other kinds of equality if he first explained through logical reasoning how nothing truly arises by itself. So at the beginning of his text "The Middle Way," he wrote: "Nothing ever arises anywhere - not from itself, not from others, not from both, and not without a cause." The words "ever" and "at any time" mean the same thing. The word "anywhere" is similar to saying "in any place" and refers to the location. These terms explain where, when, and in what philosophical system there is no arising.
The text discusses how words express both external and internal phenomena when they don't arise in three ways. The passage explains that according to <Nāgārjuna>, things cannot arise from themselves, from others, from both, or from no cause - at any time, place, or according to any philosophical system. While the <Prasannapadā> translates this differently, this interpretation is considered better. The text addresses potential misunderstandings, like comparing it to how saffron won't grow in certain places or crops in certain seasons. It clarifies that this isn't about physical limitations but about fundamental impossibility. The <Commentary> explains that the negation refers to the arising itself, not to existence in general, as the latter is implied. This shows that all four types of arising are impossible, which proves there can be no inherent arising.
This isn't saying that it's wrong to use the refutation of the four kinds of production as proof that things don't truly exist, as <Madhyamakāloka> explains. Rather, analyzing each type separately isn't what the text means to teach. Things can't possibly arise from something else at any time or place, or according to any philosophical view. As <Clear Words> says, we accept conventional reality based simply on things depending on conditions, not by accepting the four positions, since that would mean accepting that things have real existence. So, production from other isn't a term from scripture but from philosophical schools. Since this assumes "other" has its own characteristics, accepting it means accepting real existence. In this system, even in everyday life, nothing comes from other. While we say causes and effects are different things in everyday life, this isn't what "production from other" means. Just like we say everything has two natures in everyday life - while things do have a nature, we don't say this nature comes from real production.
In <Prasannapadā>, Candrakīrti explains that when things don't arise from themselves, this is a complete negation. This applies to the other three types of arising too. When proving there's no inherent nature, we're just removing what we're denying - nothing more. As mentioned in <Prasannapadā>, all worldly terms like "nothing exists" are complete negations. So when we say something doesn't exist, we mean it has no inherent nature. The <Auto-Commentary> states this after listing four main points and proves them through logic. Later, it uses the rejection of four kinds of arising as evidence to show things don't naturally arise. <Prasannapadā> confirms this after rejecting the four types of arising. Our logical proofs only aim to disprove others' claims - we're not trying to prove existence or non-existence. Instead, we're clearing away extreme views to show the middle path.
It's not that they fail to establish the simple rejection of extremes - they actually teach that the Middle Way is established by getting rid of both extremes. If you don't accept that things lack inherent existence, then logically they must have inherent existence, since there's no middle ground. As <Nagarjuna> clearly states in the <Vigrahavyāvartanī>: "If you use the absence of inherent existence to deny the lack of inherent existence, then by negating this absence, you end up proving inherent existence exists." I've explained elsewhere why accepting this kind of argument doesn't make someone a <Svātantrika>, so I won't go into that again. So what exactly are these two types of negation? Generally speaking, a negation happens when our mind explicitly rules something out. Just saying something isn't what it's not doesn't count as a negation. However, concepts like ultimate reality and ultimate truth are negations because even though their words don't explicitly negate anything, when we think about them, they appear in our mind as eliminating elaborate concepts.
There are two types of negation. A non-affirming negation simply eliminates what it negates without suggesting anything else. For example, when a brahmin asks if drinking alcohol is allowed, saying "Don't drink alcohol" just rules out drinking alcohol without saying anything about other drinks. An affirming negation eliminates what it negates while suggesting something else. For example, when trying to show someone belongs to the commoner caste, saying "He is not a brahmin" not only denies they are a brahmin but also suggests they belong to the commoner caste, which is considered lower in learning and other aspects. Something else can be suggested in three ways: directly, indirectly, or through context.
The first type is like saying "selflessness exists" - here, a single phrase both negates something and implies something else. The second type is like saying "fat <Chöjin> doesn't eat during the day" - here, the meaning is shown through implication. These two types show things either explicitly or implicitly. An example that combines both types is "fat <Chöjin>, who doesn't eat during the day, is not skinny."
Third, consider a case where we know someone must be either a royal or a brahmin, but we're not sure which. If we say "He is not a brahmin," this is an example where our words don't directly state the full meaning. As quoted in the Commentary on the Prajñāpradīpa: "Negation shown by meaning, affirmation by a single word, and not showing through one's own words - these are different from simple negation." Some argue that when combined with an affirmative basis, it can't be a non-implicative negation. This is wrong - just like how saying "brahmins don't drink alcohol" is still just negating the drinking, even though "brahmin" is affirmative. Others incorrectly claim that combining with a basis implies something else. Nāgārjuna's four positions show that effects can't arise from themselves, from others, from both, or from no cause. If things existed inherently, they'd have to arise in one of these four ways, which is impossible.
The second section covers four topics: refuting birth from self, birth from other, birth from both, and birth without cause. The first topic has two parts: refuting using the Commentary's logic and refuting using <Prajñāmūla>'s logic. The first part examines three aspects: refuting philosophers who claim to understand reality, showing conventional non-existence for those uninfluenced by philosophical views, and summarizing these refutations. The first aspect covers two points: refuting birth from same-essence causes and refuting cause-effect sameness. The first point addresses three issues: showing pointlessness of same-essence birth, showing its logical contradictions, and refuting attempts to avoid these problems.
Why don't things arise from themselves? The Buddhists explain that if a sprout comes from its own nature, nothing new would be gained since its nature already exists in the seed. The Samkhya followers argue differently - they say different causes and conditions produce one common effect because a single primary nature runs through everything. They believe the nature of the seed is the same as the nature of water, fertilizer and other conditions. While they accept the seed and sprout are different, they say the sprout comes from both the seed and its own nature. Some Samkhyas talk about unmanifest becoming manifest rather than arising, but it means the same thing. This is different from how Buddhists understand the relationship between general things and specific things like pots. If the sprout's entire nature existed in the seed, the actual sprout would have to exist then too - making it pointless for it to arise again later.
Second point: When something has already come into being, it makes no sense for it to be born again. This isn't just about the problem of things arising from their own nature - there's more to it. If someone argues for the manifestation view, we can point out two problems: if the manifested effect already exists when the cause exists, this goes against their own position; if it doesn't exist, we need to examine and reject whether the effect's manifestation and its nature are the same or different.
Since saying "self-arising goes against logic" is just making a claim without proof, here's the reasoning that shows why it's wrong: Think about a seed that has already grown - if it could grow again and again, what's stopping it from just keeping on growing as a seed instead of becoming a sprout? Nothing would stop it. This means we'd never see sprouts, stems, or shoots growing in our world. Also, the same seed would just keep growing forever until the end of time, because if something that's already grown needs to grow again, it would never stop. This shows two problems - you'd never get the next stage of growth (like sprouts), and the earlier stage (the seed) would just keep repeating forever. This clearly doesn't make sense.
Third point: Some argue that when water and spring conditions help a sprout grow, they change the seed like fermented grain and produce a sprout. Since a sprout can't exist alongside its parent seed, the seed must stop existing when the sprout appears. They claim this avoids logical problems and since seeds and sprouts share the same nature, things can arise from themselves. But this argument fails. If seeds and sprouts are completely identical in nature, how could a sprout destroy its seed? It couldn't, just like a sprout can't destroy itself. Even when shown this problem, opponents stubbornly argue that the sprout destroys the seed only in terms of appearance, not essence. But this is foolish - if everything shares the same essential nature, you can't explain different appearances, so the problem remains unsolved.
The second section contains three parts: first, showing how a seed and sprout would illogically have no differences in shape and other features; second, addressing and refuting attempts to avoid these problems; and third, showing how both would illogically be either perceived or not perceived in the same way during different phases.
First, there's another problem to consider. If a seed produces a sprout, the sprout has different features from the seed - different shape (like being longer or shorter), different colors (like being green or yellow), different tastes (like sweet or sour), different powers, and different ripening effects. But according to your view, these differences wouldn't exist because you say there's no difference at all between what a seed and sprout essentially are. However, since we don't actually observe them being identical, they can't be completely the same thing. This is what we call throwing back a reverse consequence. Note that throwing a reverse consequence is very different from throwing an autonomous reverse consequence. By "powers" we mean things like how hemorrhoid medicine works just by being near the body, or how some herbs let you fly just by holding them. By "ripening" we mean how substances change under different conditions, like how myrobalan or long pepper become sweet when soaked in milk.
Here's the second point: Someone might argue that a seed changes into a sprout by giving up its seed-state and becoming a sprout-state, and since these are just different states, the seed itself becomes the sprout. But this doesn't make sense. If something loses its original seed-nature and changes into something else with a sprout-nature, how can you claim the seed's nature is identical to the sprout's nature? The thing's state is its very identity, and you can't separate its identity from its nature. So this destroys the idea that seed and sprout are completely identical in nature. You might think that while their shapes are different, their basic substance is the same, so there's no problem. But that doesn't work either, because you can't recognize the substance of something without recognizing its shape and other characteristics.
Third, here's another problem: If you say the seed and sprout are essentially the same thing in our world, then we run into two issues. First, if the seed can't be seen when there's a sprout, then logically the sprout shouldn't be visible either. Or alternatively, if they're completely identical, then when we can see the sprout, we should also be able to see the seed - but we can't. To avoid these two problems, we can't accept that seeds and sprouts are essentially the same thing. When we understand this reasoning clearly, we can avoid wrong ideas like thinking that while things appear different, they're ultimately the same, or that something's ultimate nature stays unchanged as it changes from one state to another.
Second point: After refuting the Samkhya view of self-arising (which claims to understand reality differently from Buddhism), we can see that even ordinary people, who haven't studied philosophy, don't accept self-arising. This is because they can see that when a seed (the cause) is destroyed, its effect (the sprout) still appears - so they naturally understand that the seed and sprout can't be the same thing.
Third point: Both from an ultimate perspective and from everyday conventional understanding, things cannot arise from themselves - it just doesn't make sense. That's why when the <Noble One> refutes self-arising, he doesn't specify whether he's talking about ultimate or conventional reality - he simply says things don't arise from themselves, period. This is why when <Master Bhāvaviveka> adds the word "ultimately" when saying "Things don't ultimately arise from themselves because they exist, like sentient beings," that qualification is unnecessary.
Here's another problem with self-arising. If something comes from itself, then the effect and its cause would have to be the same thing. The doer and what's being done would also have to be the same thing. But we know they're different. That's why we shouldn't accept self-arising - both this text and the Mulamadhyamakakarika explain why this doesn't work. The Mulamadhyamakakarika points out two main problems. First, it says cause and effect can't be the same thing - if they were, then a father and son would be identical, or an eye and eye-consciousness would be the same thing. Second, it says if firewood was the same as fire, then the doer and the action would be identical. Someone might argue that things can be the same in nature but different in general, but this doesn't solve the problem - if things share the same nature, their appearances must also be the same. So if we want to understand the two truths correctly, we shouldn't accept self-arising. Since something either arises from itself or it doesn't - there's no middle ground - we must accept that things don't arise from themselves.
The second section contains two parts: presenting the previous position and refuting that system.
First, the Buddhist realists argue that self-arising makes no sense and must be rejected. Since self-arising is impossible, arising from both self and other is also impossible. While causeless arising is clearly wrong and should be rejected, they say we cannot reject arising from other things. This is because the scriptures teach that four conditions - which are inherently different from what they produce - cause things to arise. Different Buddhist schools explain these four conditions in different ways. According to <Abhidharmakosha>, the causal condition includes five types of causes (excluding the efficient cause). The objective condition includes all objects of the six consciousnesses. The immediately preceding condition refers to all previous mental states except those leading to complete nirvana. The dominant condition is the efficient cause. Other schools have different interpretations based on various texts like <Clear Words>, <Buddhapalita's Commentary>, and <Lamp of Wisdom>.
The second section has two parts: a broad critique of the view that things arise from other things, and a specific critique of the Cittamātra school's position. The first part breaks down into five sections: directly challenging the idea of arising from other, addressing everyday objections to this challenge, explaining the benefits of this challenge, showing that nothing truly arises on its own, and describing the advantages of rejecting inherent arising in both conventional and ultimate truth. The first of these has three parts: a general critique, a specific critique, and an analysis using four possibilities about effects. The first part has two sections: presenting absurd consequences and addressing attempts to avoid these problems. This first section itself has two parts: laying out the absurd consequences and analyzing them in detail.
First, the idea that things arise from other things cannot be accepted because it goes against both logic and scripture. The Rice Seedling Sutra states that "the sprout of name and form is not made by itself or by others." This contradicts many similar scriptures. Looking at the logical reasoning: If effects that exist by their own nature could arise from causes that exist by their own nature, then darkness could come from fire, and any effect could come from any cause, whether it's actually a cause or not. This is because all non-causes would be equally "other" to the effect as actual causes are. For example, if a rice sprout can come from a rice seed just because they're different things, then it should also be able to come from fire or coal, since they're equally different things. And if a rice sprout can arise from a rice seed because they're different, then pots and cloth should also arise from rice seeds. As <Nagarjuna> says in the <Root Verses on the Middle Way>: "Cause and effect can never be truly different. If they were different, causes and non-causes would be the same."
The second section contains two parts: explaining why extremely absurd consequences follow from things arising from other causes, and showing there is no contradiction in accepting the opposite of these consequences.
First, let's examine why accepting production from other leads to absurd consequences. Some Tibetan scholars claim this happens because causes and effects must occur in sequence, while things that are "other" must exist simultaneously. This argument is completely wrong because all their criticisms would apply equally to their own position. If they deny holding such a position, then their whole effort to find reasons is pointless. Many other Tibetan scholars argue that when logicians prove that smoke implies fire, or that being produced implies impermanence, they establish these relationships as universal across all times and places. They do this by first proving it in one specific case, like a kitchen or pot, then extending it to all cases based on similarity. But this approach leads to absurd consequences because it relies on mere similarity to other cases. This is what's called "toppling the dominoes of single exclusion."

Someone might ask: "What about those quotes from <Candrakīrti's> text <Clear Words> that seem to contradict accepting reverse consequences? <Candrakīrti> said that reverse consequences only apply to opponents, not to us Mādhyamikas, since we don't make absolute claims. He also said that when those who deny inherent existence argue with those who accept it, they aren't forced to accept reverse consequences. And he said consequences only serve to disprove the opponent's position, not to establish reverse claims. How do we make sense of this?"$$The answer is simple - these statements only apply when refuting self-production, not to all Mādhyamika arguments. When <Buddhapālita> and others talk about "meaningless re-production" or "endless re-production," they're specifically addressing the Sāṃkhya view that existing things can produce themselves again. We Mādhyamikas don't accept that view, so we're not contradicting ourselves. The key is understanding that existence contradicts re-production, but not production itself.
The second section contains two parts: a response that addresses potential problems, and a critique of that response.
First, someone makes this statement: While causes and effects are different in their own nature, not everything can come from everything else. We can see that specific causes lead to specific effects. Here's why: When something can be produced by something else, we definitely call it the effect of that cause. So effects are fixed. Note: This "therefore" differs from what the Commentary says. Any cause that can produce a particular effect is a cause, even though it's naturally different from the effect. So causes are also fixed. This means we establish cause and effect through specific differences, not just through general difference. For example, a rice sprout only grows from a rice seed from the same series, not from barley seeds from a different series. Even in the same series, it only comes from what can produce it - later moments don't produce earlier ones, but earlier moments produce later ones. So rice sprouts don't grow like barley sprouts do from barley. This shows that not everything comes from everything.
Second, let's examine the question of rice seeds and sprouts. When we ask those who claim causes and effects exist by their own nature: "What explains the fixed relationship between rice seeds and sprouts?", they reply "Because we observe this fixed pattern." When further questioned "Why do you see such a pattern?", they can only repeat "Because we observe it." This answer fails to explain the cause of the fixed pattern and cannot avoid the previously mentioned faults. Moreover, their position is undermined by a well-known fact: inherent difference applies equally to all things, whether causally related or not. For example, just as barley, lotus stamens, and kiṃśuka flowers are different from rice sprouts and thus cannot produce them, lack the power to produce them, aren't in the same continuum, and aren't of similar type - similarly, rice seeds too would lack these four characteristics in relation to rice sprouts, being inherently different from them. This shows we cannot establish these four characteristics even between unrelated things.
The second section contains two parts: first, a refutation of arising from other when cause and effect occur in sequence, and second, a refutation of arising from other when cause and effect occur simultaneously. The first part is further divided into two sections: the main explanation and responses to objections.
First, let's look at how we refute the opponent's view. We first discussed other-establishment as if it actually existed by its own nature, as our opponents believe, and then refuted it. Here's why it's impossible for cause and effect to be intrinsically different: Take Maitreya and Upagupta as an example - when they both exist, we can see them as different in relation to each other. But a sprout doesn't exist at the same time as its seed - the seed must transform for the sprout to appear. The seed can't be intrinsically different from the sprout, because they don't exist together. Without this intrinsic difference, how can we say things truly arise from other things? We can't. This shows that if the seed were truly different from the sprout by its own nature, it would never change (since what exists by its own nature never changes), and both seed and sprout would have to exist at the same time - which they don't. Remember though - we're not saying cause and effect aren't different on a conventional level. We're specifically targeting the idea of intrinsic difference.
Second, someone might object that a sprout and its seed cannot exist simultaneously. This is incorrect. Just like how the two ends of a scale must move up and down at the same time, the arising of the sprout and ceasing of the seed happen simultaneously. However, this analogy doesn't work because while both ends of a scale exist in the present moment, a sprout and seed don't exist at the same time - when the sprout is about to arise, it's still in the future, while the ceasing seed exists in the present. As <Candrakīrti> explains in commenting on the <Rice Seedling Sutra>, this doesn't prove things arise from other or have inherent existence. The text only refutes inherently existent arising, not the conventional arising of sprouts from seeds.
If the sutra doesn't show the seed and sprout being simultaneous like the up and down movement of a scale beam, what kind of simultaneity is the example trying to show? According to <Candrakirti>'s commentary, it's meant to show how things arise together dependently, like an illusion, without deep analysis. When we talk about things happening simultaneously, we mean two actions existing at the same time. The sutra uses the scale beam example to show simultaneity, but this can't apply to the seed and sprout being simultaneous. This means we're only rejecting the idea that two inherently existing actions can be simultaneous, not that things can't happen at the same time in general...
Here's what someone might argue: While seeds and sprouts can't arise from each other since they don't exist at the same time, some things like visual consciousness and its accompanying feelings do exist simultaneously. So these could arise from each other. For example, when we see something, our eye consciousness arises together with feelings and perceptions. But this argument fails for two reasons. First, if these things already exist together, why would one need to arise from another? Second, if we say one comes before the other, then we're back to the problem of things not existing at the same time. So the whole idea of things arising from other things turns out to be just empty words.
Third: Let's examine what a cause actually produces. If a cause produces something different from itself, we need to ask: Does it produce something that inherently exists? Or something that doesn't exist? Or something that's both existent and non-existent? Or something that's neither? First, if the effect already inherently exists, why would it need anything to produce it? It wouldn't - because if something inherently existing could arise, it would mean something already existing would arise again, which we've already shown makes no sense. And if the effect doesn't exist - like a donkey's horns - what could any conditions do to produce it? If we say it's both existent and non-existent, that's impossible, so what could conditions do there? And if we say it's neither existent nor non-existent, that's also impossible, so again, what could conditions do?
The second section has two parts. First, we accept that things arise from other things in everyday life, and show how this answers common objections. Second, we show that even in everyday life, things don't really arise from other things, which also answers these objections. The first part itself has two sections: presenting the common objections, and showing why these objections don't disprove our position.
First, let's address this: You said some reasoning proves things arise from other causes. Well, that reasoning has been completely burned away by your intelligence - like dry wood soaked in butter catching fire. You've already stirred up enough reasoning with your wisdom's fire, so there's no need to stir more. You might ask: "Don't we need reasoning to prove things arise from other causes?" Actually, no. As the saying goes, when something is already established in everyday experience, we don't need extra reasoning because what people commonly perceive is very powerful evidence. This means that ordinary people, sticking to their own views, accept everyday perception as valid proof. They directly see that different effects come from different causes. When we need to prove things, we only use reasoning for what isn't directly obvious, not for what is clearly seen.
Regarding the first point, someone argues: "Since we can directly perceive other-arising, we don't need logical proofs for it. What's the point of giving more logical arguments to prove that things arise from other things? Even without additional proofs for other-arising, we can see that things arise from other things. So why bother showing more reasoning about arising from others? There's no need, since we can directly perceive it."
Second: Some people don't properly understand what the scriptures mean. They have deeply ingrained habits of seeing things as truly existing, habits that go back to the beginningless cycle of existence. These habits have become like old friends to them. They haven't heard enough teachings about how things lack inherent existence - teachings that could help them break free from these habits. Instead, they rely on ordinary worldly ways of thinking. To help such people, we can't just tell them to stop thinking this way. We need to carefully explain which things the world can validly criticize and which things it cannot. To do this properly, we first need to explain the two truths. This explanation has five parts: what the two truths are in general, how they apply here, the nature of each truth, how to answer worldly objections, and how worldly criticism actually works.
The first topic has four parts: how things have two aspects each because of the two truths, other ways of understanding the two truths, different types of conventional truth as seen in the world, and showing that confused ideas about things don't exist even in everyday terms.
First, regarding the two truths: The Buddhas, who perfectly understand the nature of the two truths without distortion, teach that all phenomena - both internal (like mental formations) and external (like sprouts) - have two natures. These are the conventional truth and the ultimate truth. For example, even a single sprout has both a conventional and ultimate nature. This doesn't mean that the same sprout is one truth for ordinary beings and another for noble ones. Nothing can exist without a nature, and anything that exists must either be identical to or different from other things. While things have natures, they don't have inherent existence.$[continued...]
Regarding the second point: While there are different ways to classify the two truths, here we consider them in terms of what can be known. The <Meeting of Father and Son Sutra>, as quoted in the <Śikṣāsamuccaya>, says that the Buddha understands both conventional and ultimate truth. Everything that can be known falls into these two categories. Because the Buddha fully sees and understands emptiness, he is called all-knowing. This shows that what can be known is the basis for the division, that there are exactly two truths, and that understanding both makes one all-knowing. Therefore, those who claim that ultimate truth cannot be known or understood by any mind are misinterpreting the <Bodhicaryāvatāra>. The two truths - conventional and ultimate - are different aspects of the same thing, like how being made and being impermanent are different ways of looking at the same object. As the <Bodhicittavivaraṇa> explains, you can't separate the ultimate from the conventional - they're like two sides of the same coin.
Then, these two establish a relationship where one cannot exist without the other. Since this is a relationship of identical nature, like "being produced" and "being impermanent", they are shown to be identical in nature. As explained in <Tsema Nyis>, the individual characteristics are defined by what is found by the two valid cognitions. If we try to reconcile this with <Bodhicharyavatara>, how do we explain where it says: "The conventional and ultimate are the two truths. The ultimate is not an object of mind; mind is said to be conventional"? The first two lines show the division of two truths. When identifying each division, one line identifies ultimate truth and another identifies conventional truth...$[continues]
Third, regarding conventional truth, there are two aspects - objects and subjects. First, from the perspective of worldly awareness, there are two types of subjects - correct and incorrect. Not only can objects of knowledge be divided into two truths, but false perceptions can also be divided into correct and incorrect types. These include clear senses (those unaffected by temporary causes of confusion) and their resulting cognitions, and impaired senses (those affected by temporary causes of confusion). According to <Candrakirti>, cognitions from impaired senses are considered incorrect compared to those from unimpaired senses that perceive objects without distortion. However, this distinction is from a worldly perspective, not the Madhyamaka view...
Fourth, to explain what was previously discussed about how the mind's delusion affects its objects, here's a specific example: Non-Buddhist philosophers (tīrthikas), whose minds are clouded by ignorance, hold wrong views and use faulty logic. Though they claim to seek truth, they reject the basic facts of birth and death that even uneducated people like shepherds and women understand. Like someone who lets go of one tree branch before grabbing the next, they fall into wrong views and can't achieve liberation because they don't understand the two truths properly. The things they imagine, like their theory of three qualities, don't exist even in everyday reality. Similarly, things seen in illusions, mirages, and reflections - like horses, water, or faces - aren't real even conventionally. For something to exist conventionally, it must be provable. While these imagined objects don't exist even conventionally, their appearances work differently. Our current sensory perceptions of forms and sounds as inherently real are corrupted by ignorance, just like seeing reflections or hearing echoes. Though blue things and reflections can't exist inherently, they exist conventionally, just as reflections are considered forms of visual objects. This unique system applies to magical illusions, echoes, and similar phenomena.
Second point: Since our ordinary mind can't grasp the true nature of reality, we can't disprove things arising from other sources just by using everyday logic. We need to accept how enlightened beings see reality and then disprove it on the ultimate level. Here's why: Just like someone with eye floaters seeing false images doesn't invalidate what people with healthy eyes see, similarly, ordinary people's minds clouded by ignorance don't invalidate what enlightened minds see clearly. So even if things seem to arise from others in everyday experience, this doesn't contradict the ultimate truth that they don't. That's why wise holy ones laugh at anyone who argues otherwise.
The third section has two parts: an explanation of conventional truth and an explanation of ultimate truth. The first part has three sections: discussing whose viewpoint makes conventional truth true or false, explaining how mere conventional reality appears differently to three types of people, and showing how things become either ultimate or conventional depending on whether you're an ordinary person or a noble one. The first of these sections has two parts: the main point and a special explanation of how afflictions work.
First, let's understand what delusion means. It prevents beings from seeing how things really exist. When ignorance makes us think things have their own inherent existence - when they actually don't - it blocks us from seeing reality as it truly is. This blocking quality is what we call "conventional." This explains the "conventional" part of "conventional truth," but doesn't define what "conventional" means in general.
This explanation comes from the Lankavatara Sutra. It says that things only exist in a conventional way, but when you look at their ultimate nature, they don't have any inherent existence. When we mistakenly think things have inherent existence when they actually don't, that's what we call conventional truth. The word we use for "conventional" actually comes from a word that means "something that obscures or covers up the truth."
When we talk about what something conceals, the term "perfect conventional" means it's considered conventional or concealing because it hides the perfect meaning. This isn't referring to the correct conventional truth as opposed to incorrect conventional truth. We shouldn't confuse two different uses of "conventional" here - the first usage refers to how we accept things as arising and existing, while the second usage refers to our mistaken way of grasping things as truly existing.
When we grasp at things as conventionally true, we see blue and other things as if they truly existed, even though they don't. This false appearance seems real to living beings. The Buddha taught that this is called "worldly conventional truth" because it appears true from the perspective of ordinary confused people, as explained in the earlier sutra.
Things that appear false from the perspective of three types of people are called "merely conventional" because they are fabricated by false concepts and are untrue even from a conventional viewpoint. Some dependent phenomena, like reflections and echoes, appear false to those with ignorance. Other things, like blue colors, minds, and feelings, appear to them as true. However, the natural way things really are never appears to those with ignorance. Therefore, neither this natural way of being nor things that are false even conventionally can be considered conventional truths.
To explain what was said: The term "a little bit" is better translated as "some" as found in Naktso's translation. While reflections and similar things are false, they do appear as false appearances. This falseness comes from how they appear to be faces while actually being empty of being faces. So when we say they are empty of true existence, we mean they are empty of being truly faces - not that reflections lack true existence in terms of their own characteristics. Therefore, while a reflection is proven empty of being a face, there's nothing contradictory about it being true from the perspective of conventional awareness that sees it as having its own characteristics. This makes it conventionally true.
When we say that reflections aren't conventional truths, we mean something specific. In everyday understanding, a mirror reflection isn't really the face it shows, so it's false in that sense. However, this doesn't mean it's not a conventional truth as defined in Buddhist texts, which say "what is seen falsely is conventional truth." If we denied something could be a conventional truth just because it's not conventionally real, we'd contradict basic Madhyamaka teachings. These teachings say nothing exists through its own characteristics, even conventionally, and that we discuss the absence of true existence at the conventional level. So when some people say that reflections aren't conventional truths because even ordinary people know they're false, they're misunderstanding how the two truths work and how both worldly people and Madhyamika philosophers distinguish between truth and falsity.
When it is said that reality doesn't appear to those with ignorance, this actually refers to minds clouded by ignorance, since even noble ones who haven't fully eliminated ignorance can directly realize the true nature of reality. While the post-meditation wisdom of noble trainees and ordinary people's views of reality don't appear directly because they're affected by ignorance and its habits, we must accept that ultimate truth appears in some way. So when it's explained that conventional truth is established through the afflicted ignorance that's part of existence's chain, this means that the ignorance that sees things as truly existing - what we call grasping at personal and phenomenal identity - is considered the ignorance mentioned in the twelve links, not an obstruction to knowledge.
When we say that conventional truth exists because of our ignorance that grasps at true existence, we're talking about how conventional truth appears from a specific perspective. This doesn't mean that things like pots and cloth, which are conventionally true, are created by this ignorant grasping. In fact, anything that comes from such grasping can't exist even conventionally. People often get confused because the word "conventional" is used in two different ways - when we talk about "conventional truth" and when we talk about things "existing conventionally." These sound similar but mean different things, so we need to be careful to tell them apart.
Question: Are things like pots true from the everyday perspective of all people who haven't become buddhas, or are there some people who don't see them as true from their everyday perspective? Answer: For three types of advanced practitioners - Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas - who have overcome their basic confusion and see things as being like reflections in a mirror, these everyday things like forms and sounds are artificial, not true, because they don't think of them as real anymore. So there are three types of people who don't see these things as true: Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas.
Moreover, there's an important distinction about which practitioners we're talking about. Some śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas can directly realize that all conditioned things are like reflections - appearing while being empty of inherent nature. However, this ability alone isn't enough, as even bodhisattvas below the seventh ground and śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas still in training have this realization. That's why the text specifically mentions a third type of practitioner who has abandoned ignorance - meaning bodhisattvas on the pure grounds and fully enlightened śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. From their perspective, phenomena are not ultimately true.
Regarding what is untrue - this refers to both external and internal phenomena. They are untrue because while there may be a conception of truth, there is no actual attachment to truth, since the ignorance that grasps at true existence has been eliminated. This shows that external and internal phenomena are not established as truly existing from the conventional perspective of these three types of persons.
So when the Commentary proves these things "are not truths" from their perspective, without ever proving they "are not conventional truths" - anyone who thinks this proves they "are not conventional truths" is following a bad approach. Their very crude thinking contaminates the Master's intended meaning with their own mental confusion.
This demonstration is not meant for those three advanced practitioners. Rather, it shows to ordinary people like us that things are not truly real from those three practitioners' perspective. Since people at lower levels still have an innate tendency to grasp at true existence, we cannot demonstrate to them that nothing exists truly from their conventional viewpoint.
If we try to prove these aren't conventional truths from their viewpoint - which goes against what we just explained - we'd be making a completely irrelevant argument. This is because to show something is a conventional truth from that perspective, we first need to establish it as false. So using "they don't cling to truth" as a reason here is just laughable.
For something to count as conventionally true from a particular viewpoint, it must first be established as false. Here's why: When we talk about "conventional truth" - like when discussing pots and such - we have to consider both the mind and the object. The "truth" part doesn't come from the object itself, but rather from how our conventional mind grasps at things as being true. Once we understand this, we can see that without this mental qualification, things can't be established as true and must be seen as false.
Second, this system has its own unique way of defining mental afflictions, which is different from how they are explained in the higher and lower Abhidharma texts. This is important to understand, so let me explain: When we talk about grasping at the true existence of things, there are two types - grasping at persons as truly existing and grasping at phenomena as truly existing. As mentioned before, these are considered to be the two types of self-grasping.
In both the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way and the Commentary on Four Hundred Verses, holding things as truly existent is explained as afflictive ignorance. This ignorance is said to be abandoned by Hearer and Solitary Realizer Arhats, and according to the Commentary on Four Hundred Verses, it is also abandoned by bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena. Therefore, afflictive ignorance opposes the understanding of the reality of selflessness. This opposition isn't just the mere absence of understanding or something different from it - rather, it's the misconception that superimposes inherent existence onto persons and phenomena.
So when we say that adding imagined qualities to phenomena counts as afflicted ignorance, and that seeing 'I' and 'mine' as having their own characteristics counts as identity view - these positions don't match what the Abhidharma scholars teach.
According to the Abhidharma system, as explained in the ninth chapter of the Treasury Commentary, there are two ways we grasp at a self: first, we view a person as something independently real, which is called grasping at "I"; second, we view possessions as things controlled by this supposedly real person, which is called grasping at "mine". This understanding is quite different from other interpretations.
Even people who haven't studied philosophy naturally think of persons as independent, real things. However, they don't naturally think of persons as being completely different from their physical and mental parts. So there are two different ways that we can have extreme views about persons.
Someone might ask how we can prove that those who believe persons and phenomena exist with their own characteristics have both afflicted ignorance and two types of self-grasping. The answer is that since reasonings refute persons and phenomena being inherently established, holding such a view is proven to be a mistaken grasping at true existence regarding its conceived object. This proves that grasping at both persons and phenomena as truly established constitutes the two types of self-grasping. This further proves that such grasping at true existence, being opposed to understanding the nature of reality, is ignorance. Moreover, since we can prove that the view of transitory collection persists as long as this ignorance persists, it's proven to be afflicted ignorance. Therefore, it's crucial to understand how to establish this unique presentation of afflictions.
Other disturbing emotions like desire also come from the confusion of thinking things truly exist. As the <Four Hundred> says: "Just as the physical senses exist throughout the body, confusion exists in all disturbing emotions." The commentary explains that confusion means being ignorant by seeing things as truly real, which leads to strongly projecting true existence onto things.
Attachment and other emotions work by projecting ideas of beauty and ugliness onto things that delusion has made up in our minds. This means these emotions can't work without delusion and depend on it, since delusion is the main force behind them. As the text explains, this shows that delusion means believing things exist inherently.
Attachment and other emotions don't work independently from ignorance - they always operate together with ignorance, never separately. This is explained in the text where it discusses attachment and its operation. When we mentally label things as attractive or unattractive, this incorrect thinking causes attachment and aversion to arise, but this labeling process isn't the same as how attachment and aversion actually work. So when the text says these emotions only work on what ignorance imagines, it means attachment and aversion arise because we superimpose inherently existing qualities of attractiveness or unattractiveness onto things.
When we look at how attachment and similar emotions work, it's not correct to say that their only object is what ignorance wrongly sees as truly existing. This is because both types of innate self-grasping have objects that are real established bases, and since attachment and other emotions work together with ignorance, they share the same kind of objects.
When we engage our minds incorrectly in two ways, we develop aspects of wanting certain objects and turning away from unwanted ones. These become attachment and aversion. However, just having feelings of wanting or not wanting that come from seeing people as independently existing beings isn't what we mean by attachment and anger. So these two - attachment and anger - are established differently.
When it says "they also depend on delusion," this means that attachment and other disturbing emotions arise because they are first influenced by the delusion of thinking things exist with their own inherent nature.
Here's an example about how our body works: Just like our eyes, ears, nose and tongue can't work without the body's sense of touch, all our mental problems depend on ignorance and can't work without it. This means that if we get rid of ignorance, we'll get rid of all our mental problems. That's why we should really value the teaching about how things being dependent on each other means they don't exist by themselves.
The way we think things truly exist is taught in <Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness> to be the basic confusion that keeps us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. As <Sixty Reasonings> explains: "If you find any fixed point to hold onto, the poisonous snake of disturbing emotions will catch you. But if your mind has no fixed point, it won't catch you." This means that if you find any fixed point to grasp onto as truly existing, you'll be caught by the snake of disturbing emotions. Right after this, it continues: "If your mind has a fixed point, how can you avoid the powerful poison of disturbing emotions?" This is what the great master taught us.
Connecting the last two lines, it explains that people who want to get rid of negative emotions while still seeing things as having real existence cannot succeed. The commentary explains that when we see things as real entities, all sorts of negative emotions like attachment will definitely arise and can't be stopped. Why? If we find something pleasant, we can't help but become attached to it. If we find it unpleasant, we can't help but feel anger and resentment toward it. The commentary adds that even when something is neither pleasant nor unpleasant, confusion still arises. As long as we keep thinking things exist with their own nature, we'll either feel attachment or anger, and even if we avoid these two, other forms of confusion will continue.
From the "Guide to the Bodhisattva Way": When the mind holds onto objects, it gets fixated on things. If the mind lacks emptiness, after it stops it will start up again - just like what happens in meditation without perception. The three masters - these two and Buddhapālita - all interpret the Noble One's meaning in exactly the same way.
The teaching that one can reach liberation through just practicing the sixteen aspects like impermanence is actually provisional. Similarly, when this path describes mental afflictions, that description is incomplete. From this discussion, we can also understand other afflictions like pride. We should also understand that there are both learned and innate forms of the unique types of ignorance, identity view, and extreme views. I won't write more about this to avoid being too wordy.
Just like we divide our confused thoughts about things being truly real into nine levels (from big to medium) that need to be overcome through meditation, and match these with nine levels of meditation practice as their solutions, we also divide our confused thoughts about subject and object being separate things into nine similar levels, matching them with nine meditation levels as solutions. This teaching is meant to help certain students who aren't yet ready to fully understand both the obvious and subtle ways in which things lack a self-nature.
Second point: These things appear to have a real nature to ordinary people even though they don't, which is how they deceive them. However, for the three types of advanced practitioners mentioned before, since these things are fabricated and arise dependently, they exist only conventionally and not ultimately.
Noble beings in post-meditation still experience things because they have non-afflicted ignorance that counts as knowledge obstacles. Their experiences are colored by ignorance and its habits. However, noble beings in deep meditation, who are free from appearances, don't experience these things. What exactly are knowledge obstacles in this system? The <Madhyamakāvatāra Commentary> explains that ignorance habits block complete understanding, while attachment habits cause certain physical and verbal actions. Only the Buddha, who knows everything, is free from these habits - nobody else is. For example, even enlightened arhats sometimes act like monkeys or use harsh words, showing bad habits that continue even when the Buddha told them to stop.
The word "also" shows us that our habitual patterns of attachment and other emotions block our ability to understand reality clearly. These emotional habits create barriers to knowledge, and this includes all the confused ways we see things as separate from ourselves.
There are two types of mental imprints: those that are seeds of disturbing emotions and those that are not. The second type is what we call cognitive obscuration. Even when someone has eliminated all seeds of disturbing emotions and no longer grasps at inherent existence, their mind can still make mistakes about what appears to them because it's still influenced by these mental imprints.
Noble beings who haven't become buddhas still have ignorance that blocks their knowledge. Because of this, they switch between two states: when meditating deeply, they experience no appearances, but after meditation, they have thoughts with appearances. Buddhas are different - they've completely understood both the ultimate and conventional aspects of everything directly. Their minds are completely free from conceptual thoughts, so they don't switch between states with and without appearances during or after meditation.
The word "permanently" shows that other noble ones only stop their mental activity occasionally during meditation. This means they switch back and forth between meditation and post-meditation states. So when we say they still have cognitive ignorance, this isn't explaining why appearances exist - rather, it explains why appearances come and go as they alternate between meditation and post-meditation.
Mind and thoughts work through conceptual thinking. According to <Clear Words>, thinking happens when the mind is active. True reality is free from this, so it has no conceptual thinking. A scripture asks: "What is ultimate truth? It's where the mind isn't even active, so why even talk about words?"
Third point: What ordinary people consider ultimate truth is just conventional truth for noble ones who perceive appearances. The empty nature of those things is what noble ones consider ultimate truth. To explain the first part: Things like vases that ordinary people think are ultimately real are merely conventional truth for the three types of noble ones (mentioned before) who experience appearances after meditation. This means that while it denies these things are completely true from their perspective, it doesn't deny they are conventionally true. It's not saying that what ordinary people wrongly believe to be ultimately real becomes conventional reality for noble ones - that's impossible.
The later text explains that the true nature of conventional dependent origination is what noble ones see as ultimate reality. Some people misinterpret this text by claiming that something like a vase can be both conventional truth for ordinary people and ultimate truth for noble ones. This shows they don't understand that if something is conventional truth from a certain perspective, it must be rejected as truth from that same perspective.
The ultimate reality of the Buddhas is the true nature of things itself. Since this nature never deceives, it is the ultimate truth. This truth must be realized by each Buddha individually through direct experience. This is what was taught.
The word "itself" in the phrase "is nature itself" serves to exclude something specific. What it excludes is this: unlike other noble ones who experience ultimate truth as non-appearing during meditation and appearing during post-meditation, this ultimate truth remains constantly focused on the nature itself.
Regarding the phrase "that also": this explains that ultimate truth is not truly established, by showing that truth means whatever remains undeceiving when seen from the perspective of someone who perceives suchness.
The second part has two sections: explaining the root text's meaning and addressing objections. For the first section, when teaching ultimate truth, since it cannot be expressed in words or understood through verbal cognition, it cannot be taught directly. To help listeners understand its nature, an example from ordinary experience is given. As <Nag-tsho> translates, it "cannot be shown directly." In <Clear Words>, <Candrakirti> explains this using the example of someone with eye disease seeing floating hairs - even when someone with clear vision points out there are no hairs, the person with eye disease cannot see their absence as the healthy person does. Similarly, while someone might not understand ultimate truth exactly as those free from ignorance do, this doesn't mean they can't understand it at all. Ultimate truth can still be taught through definitive scriptures and understood through proper cognition.
When someone has an eye disease, they might see things like hairs or flies in their drinking vessel, even though these things aren't really there. The vessel might be made of rhinoceros horn or similar materials. Even though these perceived objects aren't real, the person will carefully examine them and, wanting to remove them, will go through the trouble of shaking and turning the vessel over and over.
When someone with clear vision without floaters goes near a person who sees floating strands, they look at the exact spot where the other person claims to see the hairs. They don't see any hair-like appearances there and don't form any thoughts about properties related to these supposed hairs. Later, when the person who sees floaters tells the person with clear vision "I see hairs," the person with clear vision wants to help correct their misperception. So they say "There are no hairs here," but in saying this, they're not actually denying the existence of the phenomenon of floaters.
When someone with blurry vision sees floating hairs, what's really there is what someone with clear vision sees, not what the person with blurry vision sees. Think about these two examples when trying to understand this point. Here's how: When people whose minds are clouded by the blurry vision of ignorance look at things like the aggregates, elements, and sense bases, what they see is just the conventional nature of these things - just like someone with blurry vision seeing floating hairs.
When we fail to see the true nature of things like the aggregates, we perceive objects in a distorted way. The Buddhas, who are free from the mental habits of ignorance and cognitive obscurations, see these same objects differently - just like someone with clear eyes doesn't see floating hairs that aren't there. What the Buddhas see as the nature of the aggregates is what we call ultimate truth.
If someone with clear vision doesn't see even a single hair floating in the air, and similarly if Buddhas don't see conventional things like the aggregates that appear to minds clouded by ignorance, then these things would not exist at all - because if they did exist, Buddhas would have to see them.
Someone might object: "If conventional things like the five aggregates didn't exist, then becoming a Buddha would be impossible, because someone who first develops the wish for enlightenment is still affected by ignorance." Here's why this objection is wrong: A Buddha's wisdom knows things in two ways - it knows everything about ultimate truth and everything about conventional truth. The first way means knowing the true nature of conventional appearances like the aggregates without actually seeing them.
As for the second point: Since a buddha cannot have indirect knowledge where things don't appear directly, they must know things by directly perceiving them. So from the perspective of the wisdom that knows all phenomena in their diversity, things are known in a way where both the knowing subject and known objects appear as distinct.
While buddhas' knowledge of the full range of phenomena is not affected by ignorance's habits that make things like the aggregates appear, they must still see how things appear to other people whose minds are clouded by ignorance. This is because such appearances must exist, and if these conventional realities exist, they must be perceived by the buddhas' knowledge of diversity.
Although someone with healthy eyesight cannot see the floating hairs that appear to someone with eye disease, this doesn't mean these appearances don't exist at all. This makes it different from the case of the Buddha.
Until we completely overcome our habit of seeing things as separate from ourselves, we can't directly understand both the ultimate truth and the way things appear at the same time. We have to alternate between meditation and after-meditation states. So we can't grasp both types of understanding in a single moment of wisdom. However, once we've completely cleared away these confused habits, both types of wisdom naturally arise together in each moment, continuously. Then we don't need to switch back and forth between understanding these two aspects of reality. This explains why the teaching says "A single moment of wisdom can comprehend the entire sphere of knowledge" - this makes perfect sense.
Although the two types of wisdom share the same nature, they work differently when knowing their two different objects - and there's nothing contradictory about this at all. This is something unique to the Buddha alone. Some people wrongly claim that a Buddha only knows ultimate reality, saying that knowledge of ordinary phenomena belongs to disciples rather than existing in the Buddha's mind. Others go even further and deny both types of wisdom, claiming that even the knowledge of ultimate reality isn't present in the Buddha's mind. More about this will be explained in the section about the final result.
If all dual appearances have ceased, wouldn't such a nature be invisible? So how do buddhas see ultimate truth? While it's true that from the perspective of seeing reality, dual appearances have ceased and they don't see things dualistically, they are said to see by way of not seeing. This answers the objection because: the wisdom that knows reality directly sees the true nature of the aggregates; the fact that aggregates don't exist from this perspective is their true nature; and this nature must be seen by not seeing the aggregates. As stated in the <Auto-Commentary>, "Without touching conditioned things, by directly realizing nature alone, they are called buddhas because they have realized reality." This means the same as saying that a buddha's wisdom that knows ultimate truth realizes the true nature without touching phenomena themselves.
The statement "Not seeing is supreme seeing" doesn't mean that simply not seeing anything counts as seeing. Instead, as previously explained, not seeing mental elaborations means seeing the state free from elaborations. These two types of seeing refer to different things. The <Condensed Perfection of Wisdom> explains this by saying that when you don't see forms, feelings, perceptions, intentions, consciousness, mind, or mental factors - that's what it means to truly see reality. It's like when people say they "see space" - how exactly do they see space? Think about that! The <Buddha> taught that seeing reality works the same way. This kind of seeing can't be explained using any other comparison. The five aggregates are what we don't see, while what we do see is called "phenomena" - meaning the true nature of reality. This matches the teaching that whoever sees dependent origination sees the true nature of things.
For example, think about empty space - we can only understand it as the absence of solid objects that would block it. When we say we "see" space, what we're really doing is noticing that there's nothing blocking or obstructing what would otherwise be visible. In this case, we see the space but don't see the obstruction. Similarly, when we talk about seeing the true nature of reality, it's not like seeing the color blue - the final line of the text explains this difference.
As proof that seeing happens in a way of not seeing, the <Entry into the Two Truths> states: "Divine child, if the ultimate truth were to become something that body, speech and mind can grasp as their object, it would not count as ultimate truth anymore - it would just be conventional truth."
However, the divine child, when it comes to what's ultimately real, ultimate truth goes beyond all our normal ways of talking about things. It has no divisions, was never born, never stops, and can't be talked about or known in our usual way. The earlier sutra explains that when someone sees ultimate truth, they don't see it by ignoring things like the aggregates. If ultimate truth became something we could experience with our body, speech, or mind, like we experience the aggregates, then it wouldn't be truly ultimate - it would just be another conventional concept. This helps us understand why we say ultimate truth is seen by not seeing it.
Regarding the meaning of the second sutra: from the viewpoint of those who directly see ultimate reality, ultimate truth has no distinctions - meaning it doesn't have many different aspects. The other three points are easy to understand.
From that perspective, it is easy to be free from speech activities.
Although we can say that wisdom directly sees ultimate reality and ultimate truth is what it knows, from wisdom's own perspective there is no separation between knowing and knower. This is because such distinctions only exist in ordinary conventional thinking. It's like how we can talk about logical reasoning as something that understands and ultimate truth as what it understands, but from the viewpoint of logical reasoning itself, there's no split between understander and understood. Then the divine child said that ultimate truth goes beyond even what the highest, all-knowing wisdom can know as its object. It's not something we can simply point to and say "this is ultimate truth."
All things are false and misleading. This means that ultimate truth goes beyond what even a fully enlightened mind can know. Here's why: When we say "This is ultimate truth," our mind naturally splits it into a subject and object - the knower and what is known. But the enlightened mind that sees reality doesn't experience things this way. Everything that appears as dual is false and misleading, so from the perspective that sees only non-deceptive reality, these appearances don't exist. This shows that ordinary things like the aggregates don't appear to someone directly seeing reality. When directly seeing reality, you can't have concepts like "exists" or "doesn't exist" because these divisions aren't found there. Therefore, only noble ones can directly know reality - ordinary people cannot. So ordinary worldly experience can't disprove what noble ones say about things not being produced from other things.
Fourth point: Some people argue that our everyday experience disproves the rejection of things arising from other things at the ultimate level. If we accepted everyday perception as valid when examining reality, then ordinary people would directly see reality. Since this would have been happening since the beginning of time, we'd have to say they've overcome ignorance. Then what would be the point of noble beings or seeking the noble path? But it's not reasonable to consider ordinary confused people as valid authorities on reality. So since everyday perception isn't valid at all when examining reality, everyday experience can't disprove points about reality. Some critics say this view is wrong because it seems to reject all valid knowledge, while others praise it for the same reason. Both misunderstand the master's position - they mistake his statement that everyday perception isn't valid for reality to mean he rejects all valid knowledge.
As explained in <Prasannapadā>, when we talk about valid ways of knowing things and the things we can know, we first need to reject the idea that they exist on their own. Instead, we should understand that they exist by depending on each other. This will be explained more later.
Fifth point: How can everyday experience invalidate something? If someone denies what is commonly known and established in everyday life, then everyday experience will prove them wrong. Here's an example: Someone says "My thing was stolen." Another person asks "What thing?" They answer "A pot." Then the second person argues "A pot isn't really a thing because it can be measured, just like a pot in a dream." In cases like this, everyday experience proves them wrong. However, when discussing ultimate reality while relying on how noble ones see ultimate truth and following those who understand ultimate truth, everyday experience cannot invalidate this.
When scholars say we should analyze other similar cases, they're pointing out how common sense can disprove those who misuse Madhyamaka philosophy. These people make claims like "I'm not really the pot's owner and Devadatta isn't really a thief," or when someone says a sprout grew in their field, they argue "The sprout can't really exist because it's just something we can observe," comparing it to things in dreams. Common sense shows why these arguments don't work.
Second point: After accepting that things arise from other sources according to everyday understanding, and having dealt with objections from everyday experience, we will now explain why there can't be any objections from everyday experience when someone wants to deny arising from other sources - because even in everyday experience, we don't actually see things arising from other sources.
Why do people in everyday life point to someone with male characteristics and say "I produced this son"? Even though they say this, the father doesn't actually take a person with male organs from his own body and put him into the son's mother. What happens instead? He simply deposits the impure substance that becomes the seed of the son's body into the mother's womb.
Because a father puts in what will become his son's body and then identifies him as his son, people naturally understand that the seed and the son aren't completely separate things. This is why people don't think of the impure seed and the son, or a barley seed and its sprout, as totally different things that come from somewhere else.
If things were truly different from each other by their very nature, you wouldn't point to your child and say "I made this," just like you wouldn't say that about someone else's child. It's like when you plant a tree seed and a tree grows - you think "I planted this tree." This shows that in everyday life, things don't truly arise from completely different things. Even though the seeds you plant aren't the same as the tree or child that grows from them, you can still point to the tree or child and say "I made this." It's like how your hand isn't you, but when your hand gets hurt or heals, we can say you're hurt or healed.
Even though things don't truly arise from other things in our everyday world, we can't disprove this kind of arising just by looking at ordinary experience. To refute the idea that causes and effects are inherently different things, we need to use special philosophical reasoning that examines the true nature of reality. So when other philosophers talk about "arising from other," they mean something that exists through its own intrinsic characteristics, not just that things are different from each other. And this basic difference between things is something that ordinary people can observe.
The statement "There is no arising from other even in the world" means more than just saying that ordinary people don't see causes and effects (like seeds and sprouts) as being inherently different things. We should understand that it's actually showing there is no arising from other even at the conventional level. This is clearly stated in the Commentary's section on refuting arising from both, which explains that just as arising from self and other doesn't make sense either conventionally or ultimately, the same reasoning shows it's impossible for those who claim both types of arising.
In the text "Clear Words," someone asks: "If things cannot arise from themselves, from others, from both, or without any cause, why did the Buddha teach that ignorance leads to formations?" The answer explains that this teaching about ignorance creating formations only applies to conventional reality, not to the ultimate nature of reality.
In response to someone asking whether we should explain how conventional reality works, the text explains that we only accept conventional reality as arising from immediate present conditions, not through any of the four philosophical positions about causation. It clearly states that even when we accept conventional dependent arising - where things arise based on their conditions - we still don't accept any of the four alternatives about how things arise. So when some people claim that "this philosophical system doesn't reject other-arising on the conventional level," they're showing they don't really understand this system properly.
Third, let's look at how things don't have inherent existence, as explained before. To show how we avoid the extremes of permanence and extinction by understanding dependent origination, here's an example: If a sprout were inherently different from its seed, they couldn't be cause and effect. Then, even when the sprout exists, the seed would definitely be gone forever. The seed and sprout would be completely unconnected, so even having a sprout wouldn't help keep the seed's lineage going. It's like how having a non-cow doesn't prevent a cow's family line from dying out, or how having ordinary people around doesn't stop enlightened beings from ending their cycle of rebirth.
Thus, when we say that a sprout is not fundamentally separate from its seed, they can still be cause and effect. When the sprout appears, the seed is gone and its continuation stops - and this actually helps us avoid the extreme view of complete destruction.
Since we often hear that a seed stops existing when the sprout appears, the Commentary explains that when we say "the seed is destroyed," we mean its continuum is interrupted. And since the text states that we reject the idea that seeds don't get destroyed, when we talk about "interrupting the seed's continuum," we really mean that its lineage comes to an end.
Since a seed and its sprout cannot exist as the same thing, the seed doesn't transform into the sprout. This means that when a sprout appears, the seed must be gone - we can't say the seed still exists when there's a sprout. This prevents the wrong idea that things are permanent. As explained in the <Lalitavistara>, "When there's a seed, a sprout follows - but the seed isn't the sprout itself. It's not different from it, nor is it the same thing. This shows how things are neither eternal nor completely destroyed." The text explains that while a sprout comes from its seed, they're neither exactly the same nor completely different. This middle way shows how things avoid both extremes of permanent existence and total non-existence. The sutra also explains this using the example of how mental formations depend on ignorance, showing how both cause and effect are empty of inherent existence.
Furthermore, this shows that what we're negating is anything that seems to exist on its own. This means the same thing as saying these things don't truly exist in reality. The <Madhyamaka-shastra> explains this same idea from the sutra by saying that anything that depends on something else to exist isn't exactly the same as what it depends on, but isn't completely different either. That's why nothing is either permanent or completely non-existent.
The fourth section has two main parts: first, we'll disprove the idea that things exist with their own characteristics, and second, we'll address objections to this disproof. The first part breaks down into three arguments: we'll show that if things existed inherently, then noble ones' meditation would destroy reality, conventional truth would stand up to logical analysis, and ultimate production couldn't be disproven. Starting with the first point: As the texts say, we must accept that nothing whatsoever is produced through its own nature. This is a point we must definitely accept, and we shouldn't argue against accepting this position.
That's not correct. If things like form and feelings had a nature that came from causes and conditions, then when a yogi directly sees that all things are empty of any built-in nature, they would be denying something real. When meditating deeply, the yogi doesn't perceive forms and such things. If these things truly existed on their own, they would have to be perceived during meditation, but they're not. This would mean these things don't exist during meditation. If they don't exist then, it would mean they existed before meditation but were destroyed by it. This would make meditation itself destroy things, just like a hammer destroys a pot. Seeing emptiness would become something that destroys the real nature of things - but this makes no sense. Therefore, since things don't have their own independent nature, we should never think they arise naturally on their own.
Some Madhyamika philosophers believe that things arise with their own characteristics, but they say this doesn't mean these things truly exist. They argue that if physical forms and other things existed through their own characteristics, they wouldn't need to be seen by someone who directly perceives ultimate reality. However, as previously explained and as will be shown again through logical reasoning, they can't escape the problem that having own characteristics already means true existence.
Here's what the Commentary tells us: In the Ratnakūṭa, Kāśyapa is taught about the middle way. When we correctly examine things through the middle way, we find that emptiness doesn't make things empty - things are empty by their very nature. The same applies to their being without marks, without wishes, unconditioned, unborn, and never coming into existence. If things had their own built-in nature, they wouldn't be naturally empty, so we couldn't say "things are empty by nature." And if we didn't deny that things exist independently, we'd have to say they're empty of something else - but this goes against the teaching that emptiness doesn't make things empty. So the middle way, when examining the nature of things, shows that nothing exists independently by its own nature.
This text explains how a sutra rejects two views held by the Vijñaptivādin school: first, that dependent nature exists through its own characteristics, and second, that it's empty because subject and object aren't different substances. Two famous texts support this interpretation. The Śatakaśāstra says we shouldn't see non-empty things as empty, and that wrong views about owning nirvana prevent us from overcoming suffering. The Mūlamadhyamakakārikā adds that while emptiness frees us from all views, those who cling to emptiness as a view are considered incurable.
This is what it means when we say "things are empty of their own nature." Some people wrongly claim that when a pot is empty of being truly real (but still exists as a pot), that's "other-emptiness," and when a pot is empty of being a pot, that's "self-emptiness." This is completely wrong. If a pot were empty of itself, there would be no pot in the pot. If something doesn't exist in itself, it can't exist anywhere else - so the pot would simply not exist at all. The same would apply to everything else, including the person making such claims! This makes it impossible to even talk about things being "empty of this" or "not empty of that." Some people think this kind of emptiness is correct, while others call it nihilistic emptiness. Both views miss the point that the Buddha and bodhisattvas have repeatedly taught: dependent origination avoids both eternal existence and complete non-existence.
Some people claim that all conventional truths must be proven empty of themselves, and they think this means a nihilistic emptiness. This is completely wrong. None of the four philosophical schools would knowingly accept and cultivate such a nihilistic view. While all forms of emptiness show how things are empty of what we're trying to negate, the emptiness of phenomena lacking inherent characteristics is specifically what we mean by being empty of their own nature. Other types of emptiness are different because once you've properly understood the first type through valid reasoning and maintain that understanding, you can't possibly think things truly exist. However, with other types of emptiness, even when you understand them properly, you might still end up thinking things truly exist due to philosophical views.
Second, someone objects: "While we need to refute arising from self and other since there is no arising ultimately, things like form and feeling that we can observe through the two valid cognitions must definitely arise from other. If you don't accept this, why talk about two truths? There would only be one truth. Therefore," they say, "arising from other exists."
Some followers of Svātantrika Madhyamaka argue this way: they accept that nothing truly arises in ultimate reality, but things arise from other things in conventional reality.
Someone argues that if we don't accept that things arise from other things in a real way even conventionally, we'd end up with only one truth instead of two. This means that without real arising through specific characteristics at the conventional level, there would be no valid conventional truth. This would make conventional truth impossible, leaving us with only ultimate truth. The response to this argument quotes a teaching that says while this reasoning is valid, ultimately there aren't two truths. As taught to the monks, there is only one ultimate truth - nirvana, which never deceives.
As it appears in scripture, "All compounded things are false and have a deceptive nature." The meaning of this statement is that since truth, as we understand it, is defined by being non-deceptive, only that which is non-deceptive can be true. Therefore, it is said "this is indeed true."
When we talk about "ultimate reality," it means that when someone sees things as they truly are, they don't see two separate kinds of truth (everyday truth and ultimate truth). Instead, they only see the ultimate truth. The highest truth is this ultimate truth. We know that everyday truth doesn't exist from this enlightened perspective because it's described as being deceptive in nature.
In simple terms, if things existed with their own defining features, then the things we experience wouldn't be false and misleading. This would mean there's no conventional truth, and without that, we can't have the two truths. However, when we understand that things don't exist with their own defining features, we can properly understand both conventional and ultimate truths.
Someone might think: "The scripture we just discussed says only nirvana is true and everything else is false. So while regular things aren't real in themselves, surely nirvana, being the ultimate truth, must be real in itself?" But this isn't correct. The sutra itself explains that nirvana's truth simply means it doesn't deceive us - not that it exists as some kind of inherently real thing.
When we hear that all conditioned things are false and deceptive by nature, we can understand that the earlier reference to truth meant something that does not deceive.
From the Commentary on Sixty Reasonings too: While conditioned things appear falsely and deceive ordinary beings, nirvana appears the same way through ultimate truth but doesn't deceive. That's why it's explained that nirvana is true and other things are false. So we must definitely understand that this division into true and false means the difference between what deceives and what doesn't deceive.
In the Commentary on the Sixty Reasonings, when nirvana is said to be true conventionally, this means we're looking at ultimate truth nirvana from a conventional perspective. This doesn't mean nirvana is actually true in a conventional sense. Since conventional truth serves as a way to reach ultimate truth, the Madhyamikas accept conventional practices just like ordinary people do when they talk about things without analyzing whether they arise from self or others.
When we look at things like physical forms and feelings, and ask whether they come from themselves or from other things, we find that in ultimate reality, they neither arise nor cease. We shouldn't analyze everyday reality by asking if things come from themselves or others. Instead, we should simply accept how things appear in the world, following the basic principle "when this exists, that happens." As Aryadeva said, just like you can't communicate with foreigners without using their language, you can't understand the world without using its everyday terms. The Root Verses on the Middle Way teaches that without using everyday language, you can't understand ultimate truth, and without understanding ultimate truth, you can't reach nirvana. The Refutation of Objections also says we can't explain anything without accepting everyday conventions.
When we talk about analyzing things, we need to understand what kind of analysis we're doing. The important kind is analyzing ultimate reality, or "suchness." The Prasangika school teaches us that this special analysis starts when we go beyond just accepting everyday labels. For example, when someone says "a sprout grows," instead of just accepting that statement, we start asking deeper questions like "Does it grow from itself or from something else?" This is very different from ordinary questions like "Where did it come from?" or "Is it inside or outside?"
The Svatantrika philosophers don't start examining ultimate reality at this point. Instead, they first look at whether things exist because we perceive them, or if they exist independently. Only then do they start examining ultimate reality. This difference comes from how they identify what needs to be disproven. Let me give you an example: Imagine Devadatta hasn't actually come here, but someone first wrongly thinks he has, then checks and realizes he hasn't. Some people use this example to claim that all our everyday understanding is wrong and only what we carefully examine is right. But this isn't what either Madhyamaka or Buddhist logic teaches - both systems say many things in our everyday understanding are actually valid. I've explained this in detail elsewhere, so I won't go into it further here.
When you use reasoning that examines ultimate reality to analyze conventional things, you should understand that this will undermine all ordinary ways of speaking about the world.
Third: When we cut through all our attachments to things as being truly real, some might anxiously say "We must still have something real that exists with its own characteristics as the cause of both bondage and liberation." To such people, only empty words remain.
Why is this so? When we analyze ultimate reality, the reasoning we discussed earlier shows that things like physical forms cannot logically arise from themselves or from other things. This same logic applies to conventional reality too - things cannot arise through their own nature. So how could you prove that things arise with their own nature through any valid way of knowing? You can't. Therefore, even if you don't like it, you have to accept that nothing arises through its own characteristics in either ultimate or conventional reality. The arising that this reasoning rejects, even on the conventional level, refers specifically to arising from some inherent substance. The summary confirms this - we're only rejecting arising through inherent characteristics, not arising in general, since we've often said that ultimate analysis shouldn't be applied to conventional things.
According to Candrakīrti, if our logical analysis of reality cannot disprove conventional arising that seems to exist by its own nature, then we also cannot disprove ultimate arising. This is because anything that exists by its own nature is automatically truly existent, regardless of whether we call it "conventional" or not. We find countless examples in the Buddhist sutras and in the works of Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, and Candrakīrti where they qualify the object of negation using terms like "by its own characteristics," "by intrinsic nature," or "by its own essence." In his text Clear Words, Candrakīrti criticizes some Madhyamaka philosophers who insist that conventional things must be established through analysis rather than mere designation. He argues that this approach would make conventional things ultimately real instead of conventional. Since this criticism applies to thinkers who accept things as conventional but not ultimate, and since it cannot apply to philosophers who believe in real entities, it clearly refers to Svātantrika Madhyamaka philosophers.
Here, some scholars claim that when the Master discusses the Noble One's statement "Not from self, not from other," this refutes only the imagined arising where subject and object are seen as different substances, but does not refute the true existence of dependent nature. However, since they cannot prove this interpretation without proper reasoning, their claims must be challenged and examined. While some earlier scholars say that Master Sthiramati and others held this opposing view, such statements cannot actually be found in their texts.
Since <Dharmapāla> explained in his commentary on the <Four Hundred> that he interpreted the view of the <Four Hundred> as <Cittamātra>, it makes sense to apply this understanding here.
Now someone might ask: "How do scholars who interpret the deep sutras from a Mind-Only view explain what <Nagarjuna> meant in his works?" While great masters like <Vasubandhu> don't clearly state how they interpret <Nagarjuna's> writings, we can see in texts like the <Vyakhyayukti> that they use the <Samdhinirmocana Sutra> to explain the <Perfection of Wisdom Sutras> as requiring interpretation. So it seems they would explain <Nagarjuna's> works the same way. After all, they couldn't possibly reject <Nagarjuna's> teachings, and if they took his words literally, they would have to take the <Perfection of Wisdom Sutras> literally too. Since they explain literal meanings as needing interpretation, they must interpret everything from a Mind-Only perspective.
However, these teachings that say nothing truly exists and nothing exists by its own characteristics can be proven through reasoning to be literally true. Since there's no good argument against taking them literally, we can't treat them as needing further interpretation. That's why it's said these teachings should just be carefully examined and debated. By showing many reasons why non-literal readings don't work and literal readings do work, we prove the text can only mean one thing. That's why this is only briefly mentioned here.
Here's the second point: If things don't truly exist in either ultimate or conventional reality, then physical forms wouldn't exist at all. If that were true, we wouldn't be able to see or experience physical things in everyday life. Someone might object that if this were the case, we should also be able to see impossible things like rabbit horns, since the logic would be the same. The response is that we all know from everyday experience that reflections and echoes appear when the right conditions come together - like having a mirror and a face, or a cave and a sound. These aren't real things, but they still appear to our senses when the conditions are right.
Just like when we look in a mirror and our mind creates a false image, even though nothing in the world has its own independent existence, things that lack independent existence can still cause other things that also lack independent existence. For example, when we see a reflection in a mirror, our eyes create an awareness of that reflection. The reflection is a real thing, separate from our awareness of it, and exists as an external object. It serves as the basis for our visual awareness, so we consider it part of the visible world. The same applies to other illusions like seeing double, floating spots in our vision, mirages, or hearing echoes. These mistaken perceptions are similar to how our normal five senses perceive things when our sense organs are working properly.
Just as faces and similar things appear even though they cannot truly exist, this is like how things appear to exist by their own characteristics even though such existence is impossible.
Since things like reflections and echoes are similar to things like forms and sounds, we can understand them in the same way. Just as we don't consider the five sense objects (like form) to be external things in terms of their inherent existence, but we do consider their appearances as external, similarly, while we don't consider reflections to be external in terms of being actual faces, we do consider the reflections themselves as external. So both cases are the same in terms of what we do and don't consider external.
Even ordinary elderly people who have never studied Buddhist texts or reasoning about emptiness can understand, through everyday experience, that a reflection lacks the real face it shows. So it makes no sense to claim that this basic understanding counts as a type of philosophical knowledge.
If this is true, even though we all know reflections are false, this doesn't prove what the <Madhyamika> philosophers mean by false. So how can we use reflections as examples? When we use reflections as examples here, we're using them because everyone in the world already accepts them as false - not because they prove what the <Madhyamika> philosophers mean by false.
When we look at a reflection of a face, we can't separate parts that look like a face from parts that don't - it all appears as a face. While this reflection doesn't actually exist exactly as it appears, it still arises from its causes. Similarly, when we look at something blue, we can't separate parts that seem to exist independently from parts that don't - it all appears to exist independently. Though it doesn't exist exactly as it appears, it can still be produced by causes and produce effects. If we can understand that a reflection exists (even though not exactly as it appears), we can understand that blue things exist (even though not exactly as they appear to exist independently).
Using the example of reflections, we need to carefully distinguish what should and shouldn't be negated when examining form and other phenomena. This distinction is essential for understanding the Middle Way view, so we shouldn't be satisfied with superficial understanding. In his commentary, <Candrakīrti> explains that while reflections lack inherent existence but still function as causes and effects, no wise person would conclude that forms and feelings have inherent existence just because we observe them. Things can exist without arising inherently. This shows the crucial difference between mere existence and inherent existence, between arising and inherent arising. Without these distinctions, we'd be forced to say things either exist inherently or don't exist at all - like a donkey's horns. As the <Commentary on the Hundred> states, those who believe in real entities are stuck in this dilemma. The special insight of <Buddhapālita> and <Candrakīrti> in explaining <Nāgārjuna's> intent was showing how things can lack inherent existence while still functioning as causes and effects, avoiding both extremes. That's why understanding these two types of existence and nonexistence is so important.
Here's how we establish understanding using the example of reflections. The <Meeting of Father and Son> teaches: "Just like reflections appear in a perfectly clean mirror without having any real essence, that's how you should understand all things like trees." You should apply other examples of illusion in the same way as explained before.
The fifth point has two parts: first, how this view helps us easily avoid extreme beliefs about things being either permanent or completely nonexistent, and second, how it makes better sense of how actions lead to results. Let's look at the first part. Think of how reflections work - just like them, nothing has its own independent existence. This applies to both ultimate reality and everyday appearances - neither has any built-in existence. Because of this, things like physical forms aren't permanently fixed, but they don't just disappear into nothing either. The <Mūlamadhyamakakārikā> explains this using the example of a seed and sprout - when we say something is destroyed, it's like saying "it existed before but now it's gone." If you believe things have their own independent existence, then saying they either last forever or completely disappear are both mistaken views.
Here, the commentary quotes from the <Mūlamadhyamakakārikā>: When the Teacher creates an emanation and that emanation creates another one, it's the same with doers, actions, and their results. This shows that things without inherent nature can arise from things without inherent nature. This explains that there's no nihilistic view because all actions and agents exist within what lacks inherent nature.
If we don't reject the idea that things exist with their own characteristics in everyday reality, we won't understand the deepest meaning of selflessness. This makes it hard to prevent subtle misconceptions about things being either permanent or completely non-existent from developing in our mind. The benefit of rejecting this wrong view in conventional reality is that we can completely abandon all such misconceptions. When we reject that things exist this way conventionally, we not only avoid wrong views about ultimate reality, but we also stay free from misconceptions about conventional reality, making it easier to abandon all wrong views about permanence and non-existence.
The second section has three main parts. First, it explains why people who reject inherent existence don't need to believe in concepts like foundation consciousness. Second, it gives examples showing how effects can come from actions that have already ended. Third, it answers objections to these ideas. The first part breaks down into three smaller sections: it explains the connecting passage, explains the main text's meaning, and discusses related points. The text shows that rejecting inherent existence has two benefits: it helps avoid extreme views about things being either permanent or completely non-existent, and it explains how actions and their results work together without needing complicated ideas like foundation consciousness or mental continuums.
Although nothing exists with inherent characteristics in how we interpret the Noble One's texts, this unique approach allows us to explain how everything still works in the world. This approach leads to several unique interpretations that other commentators don't share. What are these unique interpretations? The main ones are: First, the foundation consciousness is different from the six types of consciousness. Second, there's a special way to disprove self-awareness. Third, we don't believe that autonomous logical arguments can create true understanding in others. Fourth, we must accept external objects just as we accept consciousness. Fifth, Hearers and Solitary Realizers can understand that things lack inherent existence. Sixth, seeing phenomena as inherently existing is considered a mental affliction. Seventh, the cessation of things is itself a thing. Eighth, this leads to a unique way of understanding past, present, and future. The first point is explained here, and we'll explain later how rejecting self-awareness relates to rejecting inherent existence.
How the rejection of autonomous syllogism works has been explained in detail elsewhere, and I will also give a brief explanation here.
How this relates to accepting external reality will be explained later. The fifth point also relates to this, as follows: When <Buddhapālita> explained that the "self" that is denied in the <Śrāvaka> scriptures' statement "all phenomena are selfless" means existence through intrinsic nature, this view is also accepted here. This explains the complete meaning of selflessness. Therefore, the complete meaning of the selflessness of persons must mean that persons do not exist through their own intrinsic nature. The key point is that to understand this correctly, one must also understand the true selflessness of phenomena. This means we must accept that grasping at the self of phenomena is definitely an affliction. This leads to many differences in understanding, such as two ways of identifying afflictions (coarse and subtle), two views on whether liberation can happen just through the path of the sixteen aspects like impermanence, and different views on when cognitive obscurations are eliminated.
Both schools of Middle Way philosophy agree that someone could start on the Great Vehicle path, understand reality really well, but then end up following a lesser path like those of the Hearers or Solitary Realizers. Such a person would directly understand through meditation that things have no inherent self and would keep practicing this understanding. On this path, they would first get rid of their learned misconceptions about things having a self when they first see the truth, and then gradually eliminate their natural tendency to see things as having a self through meditation. This raises a question: do Middle Way philosophers who believe things have their own characteristics think there are two types of grasping at the self of things - one that causes suffering and one that doesn't? While there's no clear answer to this, the Self-Sufficient Middle Way scholars must believe that while Hearers and Solitary Realizers can temporarily stop obvious misconceptions through meditation, they can't completely remove the deep-rooted seeds of either type of misconception without gathering endless positive energy. So they must say that while these practitioners can temporarily stop obvious knowledge blocks, they can't completely remove their seeds.
According to this master's view, since taking phenomena to have a self is a mental affliction, we don't need the help of gathering endless collections to remove its seeds. However, he says we cannot clear away the cognitive blocks - which are the habits of seeing things dualistically - without such help. I'm explaining this because understanding these points I mentioned earlier seems to make a big difference.
Second, someone asks: "If we don't believe things exist by their own nature and we don't accept ideas like foundation consciousness, how can the relationship between actions and their results still make sense?" Here's the answer: All Buddhist schools agree that good and bad actions can produce happiness and suffering as results, even when there's a long gap between the action and its result. However, if an action had to stick around until just before its result appears, it would have to be permanent. Since nothing permanent can actually do anything, this would make the connection between actions and results impossible.
If an action disappears right after it happens, then there's nothing there until the result shows up. Since both the action and its disappearance aren't real things anymore, how can they produce any results? Some teachers answer this problem by saying we need something called the foundation consciousness to store the action's power just before it vanishes. Others say there's something like a receipt for a loan - they call it "nonwastage" - which is different from the actions themselves but keeps track of them.
Some people think that what we call "the attainment of the two karmas" is a nonassociated factor that is separate from those two karmas.
Some Buddhist thinkers believe that our stream of consciousness carries the imprints of our past actions. They say that even when an action is over, these imprints can still produce results much later - there's nothing contradictory about this. They explain that actions leave their mark in our basic consciousness, and these imprints are the action's results. These imprints continue in a chain, eventually producing effects - so the original action's results come through this chain of imprints. There are three other similar views about this. The first view comes from some Mind-Only scholars. The second view, according to Avalokitavrata, belongs to the Vaibhashika school, but not the Kashmir Vaibhashikas. The third is also from a branch of the Vaibhashikas. While the fourth view isn't clearly labeled, when we look at chapter nine of the Treasury of Abhidharma commentary, it seems to be what both the Sautrantikas and Kashmir Vaibhashikas believed.
Although the Kashmiris accept that obtainment exists, they don't believe that obtainment is produced by two factors - the thing to be obtained and obtainment itself. However, in this context, someone does assert it this way - that's what the phrase "according to whom" means.
According to the Prasangika Madhyamika school, since karma doesn't naturally arise by itself, results can come from karma that hasn't naturally ended. This means we don't need to accept ideas like alayavijnana to explain how karma works. Even when someone performs two karmic actions and a very long time - many eons - passes after these actions stop, the right results will definitely come from those actions without any mix-up. This makes perfect sense in this system's view of how karma and its results are connected. The four scholars who responded to this debate all believed that karma's beginning and ending exist by their own characteristics, and that when karma ends after being done, this ending exists by its own nature.
On this topic, it's wrong when this master tries to defend his position by saying "even though things cease in this way, there's no problem because we accept the foundation consciousness and other similar concepts." This is incorrect because karma cannot arise or cease in an inherently real way.
To show that this is exactly how Nāgārjuna would answer, he quotes from the Root Verses on the Middle Way: "Karma doesn't arise because it has no real nature. Since it never really arose, it can't really perish." This means that karma doesn't have any built-in existence, so it can't arise on its own. Therefore, since karma can't naturally cease to exist, it doesn't make sense to think that after we perform karma and it ends, it somehow continues to exist naturally without disappearing.
Although this reasoning was taught to refute non-wastage, it applies equally to refuting the other three, since the reasoning is exactly the same.
A sutra says that humans can live up to a hundred years, but these years don't really pile up into a heap. The same applies to accomplishments. When we talk about things being 'inexhaustible' or about 'karma being exhausted', from the perspective of emptiness nothing truly exhausts, while from a conventional perspective we can talk about exhaustion. This shows that exhaustion and cessation don't exist inherently but are just conventional concepts.
According to <Naktso>'s translation: Just like you can't really pile up years into a heap, you should see that this collection of things doesn't truly exist either. This explains how to understand the idea that things don't naturally stop existing.
The third section has two main points. First, it explains why we don't need to accept the foundation consciousness if we understand that things don't truly cease to exist. Second, it shows how we can still explain habitual patterns without accepting the foundation consciousness. $$On the first point: Someone might object: "Even if nothing truly ceases to exist, we still say that karma ceases in some cases. When karma is done, it must end. Since this ending isn't a real thing, and you don't accept the foundation consciousness as storing karma until its results appear, how can results appear long after the karma is gone?" This objection seems to show that our previous explanations weren't enough.$$But there's no problem here. The very fact that nothing truly ceases proves that later results can come from ceased karma. That's why no other explanation was needed.
Here's the main point: Those who believe things exist naturally say that when something is destroyed, that destruction can't be a real thing. But the Middle Way followers, who don't believe things exist naturally, say destruction is a real thing. The first group says that when a sprout is destroyed, all its parts are gone and nothing new like a pot appears in its place. So they think destruction can't be a real thing because you can't point to it - you can't find it in simple things like the color blue or in complex things like pots. The second group uses <Nyerbas> as an example. They say you can't find <Nyerbas> in his five parts alone, or all together, or as something separate from these. Yet <Nyerbas> is still a real thing that depends on these parts. Similarly, even though you can't point to destruction in the thing that was destroyed or in similar things, destruction is still real because it depends on what was destroyed.
To prove this point, <Candrakīrti> presents both scriptural and logical arguments in his text <Clear Words>. He first quotes the <Ten Grounds Sutra> which states that birth leads to aging and death. When a being dies, that death is their destruction, and this destruction is caused by birth. The same text explains that death has two functions: it destroys conditioned factors and creates ongoing ignorance. This shows that death is both caused by something and can cause something else. While this mainly refers to how a continuous stream of existence ends, the same principle applies to how single moments cease. The first moment causes its own destruction when the second moment arrives. So whether we're talking about beings being born and dying, or about moments not lasting into the next moment, the same rules apply - both can be considered real things and both are produced by causes.
Regarding this matter, <Root Wisdom> states that both things and non-things are conditioned phenomena. Similarly, <Sixty Reasonings> explains that peace comes from causes running out, which we call exhaustion. This means that both things like sprouts and their absence (when they break down) are conditioned phenomena. Just like when oil runs out it causes a butter lamp to go out, the ending of a cause leads to the ending of its effect. We must definitely accept this as the <Noble One's> teaching.
When something is destroyed, moving from one moment to the next, we need to understand this by directly ruling out what we're negating. This is a type of negation, but not the kind that just says "no" to something - it's the kind that suggests something else in its place. This is because when we rule out what's being destroyed, we're not just saying it's gone - we're pointing to something positive that comes from that ruling out. For more detailed proofs of this, you can check the commentary on the <Mulamadhyamakakarika>. This is one of those subtle but really important points in this philosophical system.
Even if we don't accept the idea of foundation consciousness, we still need to accept that good and bad actions leave traces in our mind, and these traces eventually ripen into results. We can see this in the <Madhyamakāvatārabhāṣya>, which talks about how "traces of things left in our endless cycle of existence ripen and make things appear real." There are many other texts that say similar things.
Since we need a foundation to store our mental habits, what exactly is this foundation? Those who believe in the foundation consciousness say that it's the basis for the thought "I am" that comes from the afflicted mind, and that's where habits are stored. Similarly, this system says that the natural thought of "I am" itself serves as the foundation for storing these mental habits.
Someone might ask: "How should we understand when the Avatara Commentary says that the mind-stream is where habits are stored?" Well, since what we call "I" is just a label we put on our mind and consciousness, we can call it a mind-stream. And if we think of it as a series of similar mental states following one another, this too can be where our occasional habits get stored.
According to the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way, here's how ignorance's habits work in our mind: They're like stains that seep into our mental stream and influence how we think and act. These habits, which are also called the deepest level of mental problems, ingrained patterns, or root causes, all mean the same thing. Even when monks and solitary realizers clear away their mental problems through pure spiritual practice, they still can't get rid of these deep habits. It's like how a jar or cloth might still have a faint smell of oil or flowers even after you've cleaned them out.
The same principle of two bases applies to other mental habits, both good and bad. Someone might object: "During the direct realization of emptiness, although the coarse delusions are gone, subtle habits must still exist somewhere. At this time, the mind is pure and free from confused dualistic thinking, so these habits can't exist in the mind itself. They can't exist in sense awareness or physical form either. Since this system doesn't accept a storehouse consciousness, where do these habits reside?" The answer is that there's no problem - the mere sense of "I" serves as their basis. This same principle applies to other things to be eliminated and their antidotes. If you understand how this system uniquely explains the nature of persons, you can answer objections like: "When noble beings in the formless realms experience transcendent wisdom, their ordinary mind ceases, so wouldn't their existence end?"
When a noble one born in the highest realm experiences an uncontaminated state of mind belonging to the Nothingness realm, this creates a problem. The beings of both realms would cease to exist, since this pure mind can't belong to either realm or to nirvana. However, this argument doesn't disprove our position, since we can establish realms of existence without defining them by either pure or impure minds. Our opponents claim that for those not yet on the path and those in training, the nature of their realm is neutral and unobstructed. How could someone like me make such statements about these great systems? I'm only speaking based on the teachings of the great masters who truly understand <Nagarjuna's> intent. Looking at these explanations, it seems the other arguments for proving store consciousness also don't invalidate our system. This should be examined by those with great, sharp, and subtle wisdom.
Second point: Here's an example to explain how effects come from actions that have ended. Think of a fool who sees a beautiful woman in his dream. Even after waking up, he still feels strong desire for what he saw, even though that dream-woman no longer exists. Similarly, even though actions may have ended and don't have any real existence of their own, they can still produce effects. This shows how effects can come from actions that have already ended.
To prove this point, the "Sutra on Moving Between Lives" tells this story: A king asks the Buddha about a man who dreams of being intimate with a beautiful woman from his region. After waking up, the man keeps thinking about this woman. The Buddha asks the king if such a man should be considered wise. The king answers no, explaining that since the woman in the dream wasn't real and couldn't be found in reality, how could anyone actually be with her? Such a man, the king concludes, would only end up suffering and exhausted. This story serves as an example.
Here's how this applies: Just like that, Great King, when ordinary foolish people who haven't studied much see things with their eyes, they get attached to things that make them feel good. Once they're attached, they develop more attachment. This attachment leads them to act with their body, speech and mind in ways driven by desire, anger and confusion.
When an action is fully formed, it stops existing. After it stops, it doesn't stay fixed in the east or in any other direction, including the in-between directions. This is what the text says. Not having proper learning means you don't understand the true nature of reality even when you hear teachings about it.
Manifest attachment is attachment to what we believe is true.
When it comes to actions that come from attachment, they can be either good or bad. Actions that come from hate are always bad. Actions that come from confusion can build up to be either good or bad.
When we do something, it stops existing right away - but that's just how we talk about it in everyday terms. The deeper truth is that things don't really stop existing in some fundamental way. Now, when someone is about to die, the karma that kept them alive runs out. At their final moment of consciousness, something interesting happens. It's like when you wake up from a dream about a beautiful woman - your mind immediately turns to think about that dream. Similarly, when the karma that kept your current life going runs out and your final consciousness is ending, your mind turns toward the karma that will shape your next life. But unlike the dream example, you're not actually remembering anything - it's just your mind naturally turning toward what comes next.
Thus, when the final consciousness ceases and the first consciousness of the next birth arises, as stated in the text from "whether among the gods" up to "or it will arise among the hungry ghosts," the final cessation refers to that of this life.
When discussing how the first consciousness arises at birth, the text mentions "among the gods" and similar examples. The intermediate existence isn't counted among the six types of beings - it's part of the birth existence. While there is an intermediate existence between death and birth, many texts don't mention it because they focus on explaining how karma and its results work mainly in terms of birth and death. After this first consciousness ends, a stream of mind arises that matches what karmic ripening one will experience.
"Great King, nothing moves from this world to the next world, but we can see death and rebirth happening. Great King, when the last moment of awareness stops, we call that death. When the first moment of awareness starts, we call that birth."
Great King, when final consciousness stops, it doesn't go anywhere.
When consciousness that is connected to birth appears, it doesn't come from anywhere. Why is this? Because it has no inherent nature of its own.
Great King, final consciousness has no inherent final consciousness. Death and transmigration has no inherent death and transmigration.
Karma is empty of karma itself.
The first consciousness is empty of itself.
A text states that while birth is empty of birth itself, actions still have their effects. When we take rebirth, we experience happiness or suffering from our previous actions. The consciousness that experiences these results comes from the first moment of birth consciousness. While death, moving between lives, and birth exist in everyday terms, they don't exist ultimately because they lack any inherent nature. This explanation about lacking inherent nature applies to teachings about how the final consciousness and other things are empty of themselves. The text then adds that actions don't go to waste, to prevent people from wrongly thinking that karma and its results don't exist at all.
The third section has two parts: addressing concerns about endless karmic effects, and addressing concerns about contradicting teachings on the foundation consciousness. $$On the first part: Someone might worry that if actions without inherent existence can produce effects because they don't truly cease, then effects that have already ripened would keep producing more effects endlessly. Here's why this isn't correct: Think of someone with an eye disease - they see floating hairs that don't really exist, but they don't see other non-existent things like donkey horns or a barren woman's child. Similarly, while all actions equally lack inherent existence, only unripened actions produce effects, while already ripened ones don't produce more effects.
This example shows two things: First, it proves that actions definitely produce results. Second, it shows that good and bad actions produce their own distinct results - pleasant results come from good actions, and unpleasant results come from bad actions. It's like how someone with an eye disease will definitely see floating hairs but won't see non-existent things like donkey horns. In the same way, pleasant results never come from negative actions, and unpleasant results never come from positive actions. Therefore, unpleasant karmic results come from negative actions...
One can see that pleasant results come from virtuous actions.
Those who understand that virtuous and non-virtuous actions don't truly exist - meaning they realize nothing exists inherently - will be freed from the cycle of existence. For this reason, when ordinary people tried to analyze in detail how specific causes lead to specific results using logical reasoning, the Victor was concerned they might end up denying karma and its results, which would destroy conventional truth. So he declared that how actions ripen into results is beyond comprehension, thereby discouraging people from analyzing karma and its effects too deeply.
This text uses many different methods to help us be certain about karma and its results, because it's worried we might lose that certainty through various misunderstandings. Keep this in mind, and let the understanding of emptiness help strengthen your certainty about karma. Then make sure your current visit to the Precious Island doesn't go to waste.
The second section has three parts: explaining how to resolve scriptural contradictions, discussing whether the scriptures teach about a foundation consciousness separate from mental consciousness, and showing examples of teachings that need interpretation. $$On the first point: Someone might ask: "If we can explain karma and its results without foundation consciousness, why do texts like the <Lankavatara Sutra>, <Samdhinirmocana Sutra>, and <Mahayana Abhidharma Sutra> teach about foundation consciousness as the basis for all potentials, containing all seeds, and causing all phenomena like waves from an ocean?"$$The answer is that foundation consciousness was taught for those who needed this concept. This shows that in our system, foundation consciousness is taught with a specific intention - it actually refers to emptiness, the lack of inherent existence.
Regarding what is taught as the alaya, this is because that nature pervades all things.
The Buddha teaches that both the foundation consciousness and the person exist as real things, but for different reasons. He teaches this to help guide people who need to understand these concepts. As he said to his monks: "The five aggregates are like a burden, and the person is the one who carries this burden." When people asked if a person exists as an independent thing, rather than saying no, the Buddha explained that a person exists as someone who carries the burden. While he didn't directly use the word "substantial," he was teaching that the person has a real existence.
Furthermore, to some students, the Buddha taught that there are no real persons, only the groups of elements that make up a being. He explained that what we call mind, mental faculty, or consciousness - when it is developed through faith, good behavior and other virtues for a long time - will progress and be reborn in higher realms in the next life.
Moreover, when people who believe in the true existence of paths to higher realms and liberation wonder how much they should accept, the Buddha teaches that there are merely aggregates. While he doesn't refute their clinging to truth, this implicitly teaches that the aggregates are true. All these teachings were given according to his specific intention.
"For whom was this teaching intended?" someone might ask. The answer is that it was meant for those who accept the existence of the alaya-vijnana and believe in the substantial existence of persons.
This teaching that "only these aggregates truly exist" was given with consideration for those disciples who are not yet able to understand such profound meaning as previously explained.
Some students who have been deeply influenced by non-Buddhist views for a long time cannot grasp the deep nature of reality. As mentioned in the <Ratnavali>, when they hear statements like "There is no self and never will be, there is nothing that belongs to me and never will be," these inexperienced practitioners become frightened. When taught about the true nature of reality right away, they get scared and see Buddhist teachings as dangerous like a cliff edge. They turn away and won't engage with the teachings, so they can't achieve anything meaningful. For these students, instead of teaching the deepest truths immediately, it's better to start with concepts like store consciousness and the real existence of the aggregates. This helps them move beyond non-Buddhist ideas and leads them to greater understanding. Later, when they truly understand the scriptures, they will naturally let go of believing in things like store consciousness. So this teaching approach only brings benefits, not problems.
Thinking about this sequence, the <Śatakaśāstra> says: "Whatever someone likes, they should practice that very thing first. Someone who has fallen from the path is definitely not a suitable vessel for the sacred Dharma."
For those who need to learn about the alaya consciousness as something different from the six sense collections, they first need to understand that external things don't truly exist. This makes them ready to understand the nature of reality - that subject and object aren't two separate things.
Even if you don't accept the alayavijnana (foundation consciousness) as previously explained, you won't be able to understand the deepest meaning since you can't establish how actions and their results are connected.
When counting types of consciousness, many Buddhist texts including the Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand only mention six kinds of consciousness, nothing more. Many sutras don't mention foundation consciousness at all. Just as sutras take two approaches - either accepting or not accepting foundation consciousness - Maitreya follows the same pattern in his commentaries. In his Middle and Extremes, Ornament of Sutras, and Differentiation of Reality, he accepts foundation consciousness and denies external objects. But in his Ornament of Realization and Ultimate Continuum, he doesn't accept foundation consciousness and allows for external objects.
The great teacher <Asanga> also did not explain the <Uttaratantra>'s meaning according to the <Cittamatra> view, but rather explained it according to the <Madhyamaka> view. In his commentary on the <Uttaratantra>, regarding the <Abhidharma> scripture that was quoted in the <Mahayanasamgraha> as proof of the foundation consciousness, it states: "Although sentient beings have the <tathagata> element that has become their essence, these sentient beings do not know it."
As stated in scripture: "The element that has existed since beginningless time is where all phenomena reside. Because this element exists, all beings can attain nirvana." This quote is used to prove that sentient beings possess the natural disposition of reality itself. Therefore, since this master explains that the intended meaning of the foundation consciousness is emptiness, he maintains that a foundation consciousness separate from the six consciousness groups was taught only as a practical teaching device for certain students.
Someone asks: "In the Commentary on Awakening Mind, there's a passage about how foundation consciousness holds onto existence. It uses examples like iron moving near a magnet, and trees swaying in the ocean - things that move without having minds. How should we understand this?"$$The answer explains that this teaching isn't meant to be taken literally. It was taught to help beginners who might be scared by the idea that everything is empty. The text is actually responding to a worry from the Yogācāra school. They believed in a pure, truly existing mind that comes from transformation. When this view is challenged, they ask: "If mind isn't real, how can beings move between past and future lives?" The text uses these examples to show that just like iron and wood can move without minds, consciousness can appear to move between lives without being truly real.
Someone might say: "Even if we don't believe the foundation consciousness exists in its own right, we can still accept it as something different from our six regular types of consciousness - like an illusion that holds the seeds of both our ordinary and enlightened states." But here's the problem: if you accept this kind of foundation consciousness, you'd have to say that things like forms and sounds only appear because of stored patterns in this consciousness, and that nothing exists outside of mind. But as the text itself says, "You can't have awareness without something to be aware of - so why not admit that both the knower and the known don't really exist?" This shows that outer objects and inner awareness either both exist or both don't. This matches what we're taught here - that both objects and awareness equally exist conventionally but don't ultimately exist. So we can't say one exists while the other doesn't, at either level of truth. That's why the master doesn't accept a foundation consciousness separate from mental awareness. When he talks about "foundation consciousness," he just means either mind in general as basic awareness and clarity, or specifically mental consciousness. This makes sense because it explains how things can work without inherent existence, how mental consciousness takes rebirth, and how it serves as the basis for both our confused and enlightened states.
In the text "Heart of the Middle Way," the literal interpretation of the foundation consciousness is rejected. Also, since Master Jnanagarbha accepts external things, he does not accept the foundation consciousness.
Among Buddhist philosophers who follow the Mind-Only school and reject external objects, some accept the foundation consciousness while others don't. For example, Master Kamalashila, who denies external objects, states that only mental consciousness can link one life to another. He quotes from the Treasury of Abhidharma to support this: "Only mental consciousness is responsible for cutting off and connecting between lives, becoming free from desires, declining, dying, and being reborn." This shows that the great master Shantarakshita also didn't accept the foundation consciousness. Abhayakara held the same view.
While other Mahayana texts mention something called the "all-ground consciousness," they don't clearly explain what this term actually means beyond just using the name. When you look into what they're really saying, it seems they only consider it as not being fundamentally different from the six groups of consciousness. Since this approach seems to accept that external things exist, they're really just using this term to refer to mental consciousness. I could explain all this in much more detail, but I'll stop here to avoid being too long-winded.
The Buddha taught about foundation consciousness to help guide his disciples. Even though he himself was completely free from seeing things in terms of "I" and "mine," he still used these terms to help ordinary people understand his teachings. In the same way, although nothing has true inherent existence, the Buddha taught about inherent existence as a temporary teaching to help people gradually understand the true nature of reality.
In simple terms, when we say "I" and "mine", while it seems like these concepts exist, the ultimate truth is that there are no such concepts. Similarly, while it appears that the Buddha taught that things have inherent existence, the ultimate truth is that things don't exist that way.
According to verses from the Eastern Mountain School, here's how to work with conventional concepts in a way that makes sense to ordinary people: If spiritual guides didn't communicate in ways people understand, nobody would grasp what Buddha nature is or recognize a Buddha. While understanding that things like our body parts, elements, and senses are essentially the same, teachers still talk about the three realms - this is speaking in a way people understand. They use familiar words to explain teachings that are actually beyond words - this helps people understand. While showing that nothing truly exists and staying in Buddha nature, they teach that even non-existence isn't real - this makes sense to people. Without getting caught up in meanings or meaninglessness, they teach about stopping suffering and ultimate truth - this works for ordinary folks. Though nothing is ever destroyed or born, and everything equals ultimate reality, they still teach about world-ending fires - this helps people understand. Even though you can't find any real nature of beings in past, present or future, they teach about beings - this connects with how people think.
Among these teachings, the last verse explains that living beings have no inherent self, which shows how persons lack a self. The other verses explain how all things and non-things lack any inherent nature, which shows how phenomena lack a self. According to the "Blaze of Reasoning," the Eastern Mountain School broke away from the Great Assembly School over time. This shows that at least one text in the Hearer tradition clearly teaches that phenomena lack any inherent nature.
The second part looks at specific problems with the Mind-Only (Cittamātra) view. This has three sections: First, it shows why consciousness without external objects can't exist on its own. Second, it examines why their proof for the dependent nature existing on its own doesn't work. Third, it explains that when the Buddha talked about "mind-only," he wasn't actually denying external objects. The first section has two parts: explaining what the Mind-Only followers believe and then showing why they're wrong. The Mind-Only followers don't like how the Middle Way (Madhyamaka) explains things and say it's not what the Buddha meant. Instead, they came up with their own interpretation. They say that when a bodhisattva on the sixth level practices the highest wisdom, they understand reality correctly without making the mistake of thinking subject and object are separate things, and realize everything is just consciousness.
Since there is no physical reality outside the mind, we understand that mind and mental events exist just as dependently arising phenomena, without having external objects as their referents. This is what we mean by "realizing the true nature of reality in terms of mind-only."
How does a bodhisattva come to understand the true nature of reality? A bodhisattva realizes that physical forms and other phenomena arise from the ripening of inner mental habits. They see that there are no objects separate from the mind, and therefore no subject that perceives such objects. They deeply understand that all three realms of existence are just consciousness. They then spend a long time getting familiar with this understanding of non-duality. Through this practice, they directly experience through self-awareness something that cannot be expressed in words - the very essence of non-duality. This is how a bodhisattva on the sixth level comes to understand the true nature of reality as consciousness-only.
Someone asks: "If everything is just mental awareness without external objects, how can mind create appearances of external things when there aren't any?" The answer is: Think of a vast ocean. When strong winds stir up the previously calm waters, waves arise and flow everywhere, taking their own shape as they compete with each other. Similarly, our foundation consciousness contains seeds of all inner and outer experiences. When mental habits from our attachments and positive qualities like faith ripen, they produce experiences that seem to show inner and outer things as separate. Ordinary people think these experiences show real separate subjects and objects, but actually nothing exists separately from consciousness itself.
This is similar to how people who believe in <Ishvara> as the cause of everything make their argument. They say that just as a spider creates spider webs, a crystal seems to create water, and a bilanga plant creates branches, <Ishvara> creates all living beings. Just like these believers in <Ishvara> claim he is the creator of beings, those who believe in the storehouse consciousness say it contains all seeds because it supports everything that consciousness can observe.
The difference is this: while the divine ruler <Ishvara> is eternal, the storehouse of consciousness is not permanent. That's why people who have gotten used to non-Buddhist views over many lifetimes can be helped by teaching them about this storehouse consciousness.
When discussing the Mind-Only school's views, we find an interesting question in <Commentary>. The text often says there's "no external reality" and that "nothing exists separate from consciousness." When talking about physical things like forms and sense organs, sometimes it adds "separate from consciousness" and sometimes it doesn't. This raises a question: Should we always add this qualification when discussing the Mind-Only view, or should we simply say these things don't exist at all? Looking at texts like <Mahāyānasaṃgraha> and other important sources, we can see that the Mind-Only school actually accepts certain forms of physical existence, just not independent from consciousness. This makes sense because otherwise, they couldn't even use normal words to describe things in the world.
The term "proponents of internal objects of knowledge" means this: things we can know - like forms, sounds, and so on - are not considered to exist outside of us, but rather are said to exist as mental phenomena in our consciousness.
Someone might say: If the Mind-Only school accepts things like physical forms and sounds, then their rejection of external reality is just arguing about words. After all, they're accepting the very same forms and sounds that appear as external objects. This is like saying that when the Middle Way school denies that things have inherent existence while still accepting those things, they're actually accepting the very same things that appear to have inherent existence. In both cases, arguing about whether these things exist or not becomes just a word game. This is a major challenge for both philosophical systems. Not only is the Middle Way approach difficult, but the Mind-Only system also faces this problem: if you reject external objects, you end up rejecting forms and sounds too; if you accept forms and sounds, you have to accept external objects. These are complex issues, but I won't write more as it would get too lengthy.
Because the scriptures are known to be presented as explained above, we must accept that the dependent nature has an intrinsically established essence. This is because it serves as the cause and foundation for all conceptual networks, including our tendency to grasp at subject and object as having separate substantial existence.
When you mistake a rope for a snake, this mistaken perception can only happen if there's actually a rope there in the first place.
Just like you can't have illusions of vases appearing in empty space without any physical ground, if there are no external objects, what could possibly cause our mind to mistakenly think it sees blue and other colors as external things? This means we must accept that there is an impure dependent nature that appears as a duality of subject and object (which seem different from each other), and this is what causes us to mistakenly think things are external. This same basis is what causes both our bondage to suffering and our potential liberation.
According to both Madhyamaka and Cittamatra schools, things appear to beings in a certain way, and they cling to these appearances as real. If you teach that what appears is empty of being the way people think it is, then understanding this emptiness becomes a spiritual path. But if you ignore how ordinary beings cling to things as real, and instead try to prove some other kind of emptiness is real, you're wasting your time. This won't help overcome any of the deep-rooted habits of believing things are real that we've had since forever.
When we look at things, they seem to be split into two - a subject that perceives and an object that is perceived, appearing as two separate things. But this way of seeing things as really existing the way they appear is just our imagination. When we understand this correctly, we see that things are empty of being the way we imagine them. What remains - the basic reality and its emptiness - does truly exist. Understanding this exactly helps us grasp what emptiness really means.
Here, the earlier interpretations found in the <Bodhisattvabhumi> and <Madhyantavibhaga Commentary> explain the phrase "whatever is not in whatever" in the way described above. However, the <Uttaratantra Commentary> explains this same phrase in a completely different way, following the Madhyamaka approach. I haven't written out this explanation because it would be too lengthy.
The dependent nature comes only from its own habitual patterns, without any external objects that can be grasped.
It exists by its own nature, and according to this system, it exists with a nature that is ultimate and beyond all verbal and conceptual elaborations, because both external and internal expressions grasp the unanalyzed aspect.
In simple terms, the dependent nature has three special features: it arises without external objects, it exists by its own nature, and it is not an object of ultimate elaborations.
Whatever can be analyzed belongs to the category of inherently existing things, so it cannot be separated from the three characteristics.
When we say something depends on other things to exist, we're not just saying it exists - we're saying it exists in a special way. As Master Sthiramati explains, when we say "false imagination exists," we need to add the words "by its own nature" to complete the meaning. This distinction becomes really important later on.
The second section has two parts: a detailed refutation and its summary. The first part contains three sections: disproving the example of mind-only without external objects, refuting the idea that consciousness arises from mental imprints without external objects, and showing how this refutation doesn't conflict with meditation on unattractiveness. The first section has two parts: refuting the dream example and refuting the example of seeing floating hairs. The first part breaks down into three: showing how dreams don't prove mind's inherent existence, showing how dreams don't prove external objects don't exist while awake, and showing how dreams prove all things are false. First, when the <Cittamatrin> philosophers claim that external objects don't exist but mind exists inherently, we must examine what example they could possibly use to prove this.
The Mind-Only school says: "Imagine someone sleeping in a tiny room who dreams of a herd of mad elephants. Those elephants cannot possibly fit in that room. Similarly, just like in a dream, while external objects don't exist, we must definitely accept that consciousness exists inherently." To show this argument is also without essence, it is explained: "Let's examine this example carefully."
What exactly should we examine here? According to my system, just as there are no real elephants as objects in dreams, there is also no mind that appears like a herd of drunk cattle and exists through its own characteristics even in dreams, because such a mind is unborn.
If consciousness isn't real in its own right, then your example doesn't work for either side, so consciousness can't exist without external things.
Here we're not saying that consciousness doesn't exist in the same way that dream elephants don't exist. Instead, we must understand this is teaching that consciousness lacks intrinsic existence. Why? Because as previously explained, while the Cittamatra school accepts a dependent nature that lacks external objects, they consider this dependent nature to be intrinsically established. When summarizing these refutations, the text states "Just as there are no objects of knowledge, there is no consciousness either." The commentary clearly explains this means that consciousness which appears to have the aspects of objects of knowledge is not produced by its own nature.
Furthermore, when examining both the root text and commentary, we find many instances where they carefully qualify what exactly is being refuted. The great master himself asks "Why was it taught that mind arises from ignorance and karma?" This shows he accepts that ignorance produces karmic formations, which in turn produce consciousness. Therefore, intelligent people should have no doubt that this system does not actually claim consciousness is non-existent. When discussing whether objects of knowledge and consciousness exist or don't exist as equivalent cases, we must always understand this in terms of the specific qualifications of what is being refuted.
Someone might argue: "If there's no confused consciousness during dreams, then after waking up we wouldn't be able to remember what we experienced in the dream." This argument wrongly assumes that if consciousness doesn't exist inherently, it must not exist at all.
This argument doesn't work either. If you claim that dreams must be real because we remember them when we wake up, then everything we see in dreams - like elephants - would have to be real too. Why? Because just as you remember the experience of seeing things in your dream when you wake up, you also remember the objects you saw in the dream. So you have to either accept that dream objects are real, or admit that even dream consciousness isn't real.
Well then, you might ask: since we remember both what we experienced and what we saw in dreams, how should we understand whether these memories really exist or not? The Commentary explains that we can remember two things: the experience of having the dream itself, and our experience of the dream's contents. For example, when we dream of an elephant, it's like looking at a reflection in a mirror - just as our eyes don't actually experience the real face but experience seeing its reflection, similarly in a dream we don't actually experience a real elephant, but we do experience something appearing as an elephant. So when we say we "remember the object," what we're really remembering is our experience of perceiving that object.
Distinguishing between what we perceive and experience isn't necessary in most cases, with just a few exceptions. When we examine the Cittamātra view that dependent nature exists without external objects and is established by its own characteristics, we find it impossible to defend. Why? Because not only can we not find any direct examples of this, but unlike other cases (such as proving past and future lives) where we can work around the lack of direct examples through different logical approaches, here we don't even have that option. This shows just how powerful the arguments against the Cittamātra position really are.
Second point: When we dream of elephants and other things, you might think the eye-consciousness that sees them must also exist in the dream. But this doesn't make sense. When we're asleep, our visual awareness is shut down because sleep disrupts it. So dream elephants and other forms can't actually be seen by our eyes - only our mind is aware of them. This proves that there aren't really any external physical forms, and our mind just creates appearances that we can't help but think are external things.
Someone might argue that just like in dreams where we experience only consciousness without external objects, the same must be true when we're awake. This argument suggests that even if earlier examples don't work, the dream example proves that consciousness exists without external objects in our waking state. However, this argument fails because mental consciousness cannot actually arise in dreams. Even if we accept that visual forms don't exist in dreams, it's impossible for mental consciousness to exist inherently without these forms, even in dreams. Therefore, you can't use this as an example of consciousness existing both without external objects and with inherent existence.
According to you, just like objects in dreams aren't real, our mental awareness isn't naturally produced either. So just like when we're awake and see something, three things come together - our eye, the thing we see, and our mind - the same happens in dreams. When we understand things in dreams, our mind observes these three elements coming together.
Just like in a dream where there are no eyes and no visible forms, the visual consciousness that comes from these two also doesn't exist. So the eyes, forms, and mind that appear in dreams are all false.
Just like those three aspects we discussed, the three sense powers of hearing and the other senses (beyond those of seeing) also do not arise with any inherent nature.
In this text, the author explains how different types of consciousness work in dreams. He criticizes those who misunderstand and misrepresent the teachings. The phrase "and so on" includes various types of consciousness from hearing to mental awareness. Just like with visual consciousness discussed before, these don't really exist in dreams but only appear to. Even mental consciousness, while present in dreams, lacks true existence. The author strongly criticizes some Tibetan scholars who misunderstand these teachings and lead others astray. He warns that such misunderstandings can create negative karma for many people.
Here's what's happening: The Mind-Only school makes a claim about dreams. Master Bhaviveka responds by saying their example doesn't work. He argues that in dreams, there are mental forms that consciousness can grasp, so consciousness always needs an object. But this argument fails because you can't have all three elements (object, sense faculty, and consciousness) truly existing in dreams. If Bhaviveka accepts these three elements just to defeat his opponent's position, then using dreams as an example becomes pointless - because if dreams were real rather than false, you couldn't use them to show how things are false. The key point is that even in dreams, these three elements can't exist in an inherent way.
We should explain that it doesn't make sense for there to be a form in the mental phenomena domain that is separate from consciousness during dreams. While we must accept the existence of such form, and there's nothing contradictory about it existing in dreams, <Bhāviveka>'s clear acceptance of this form as being established by its own characteristics should be used as evidence for why such form actually doesn't exist.
If we try to reject the Cittamātra view (which uses dreams as an example to show there are no external objects) by claiming that forms must exist with their own characteristics, then it makes no sense for the Mādhyamika to use dreams as an example to prove things lack true existence.
A dream has real meaning and isn't just false, because it exists with its own characteristics as shown in examples. The actual things that dreams represent can't be proven false, because until we disprove inherent existence, we can't use logical signs, properties and examples to prove things lack true existence. That's why our earlier explanation that everything appearing in dreams lacks inherent existence was exactly right.
According to our tradition's view, you might wonder whether the vivid forms we see in dreams count as mental domain objects. Here's the explanation: In dreams, we don't have physical sense awareness, so the five types of objects we seem to see are actually only appearing to our mental awareness. While we can't say these are physical sense objects like regular visible forms, they are similar to how a skeleton might appear clearly to the mind alone - they belong to the mental domain. Specifically, they fall into the category of conceptually constructed forms within the five types of mental domain forms. This principle helps us understand many similar cases.
Third point: In dreams, what appears as objects, senses, and consciousness are all unreal. Using this fact that dreams lack true existence, we can prove that other phenomena also lack true existence. This is why it is taught that even when we are awake, all phenomena can be proven to lack any inherent nature.
Just like things we see in dreams - the objects, our senses, and our awareness of them - are not real, everything we experience while awake is also not real. This means our mind doesn't truly exist on its own, and neither do the things we sense, like shapes and forms, nor do our senses themselves truly exist. This is why the Sutra teaches us: "When we see beings created by magic, they seem real but aren't actually there - just like illusions and dreams. This is what the Sugata taught about all things." It also says: "All beings in this world are like dream figures - nobody is really born or dies here. You won't find any real sentient beings, humans, or life force. All these things are as empty as foam or banana trees."
The phrase "no one is born" should be understood with the same qualification used earlier - "in reality, not real." When the sutras use dreams as an example to show that nothing truly exists in reality, this explanation works well for the Madhyamaka view but not for the Cittamatra view. That's why this is considered a good explanation.
In this world, some people are awake from ordinary sleep but still caught in the deeper sleep of ignorance. For these people, even though nothing truly exists by itself, they experience things as if in a dream due to their ignorance, and they perceive all three aspects of experience (objects, senses, and consciousness) as real. Similarly, for those who are still asleep and not awake, as long as they remain in that state, they also experience these three aspects as real from their perspective.
When we wake up from sleep, the three parts of our dream disappear. In the same way, when the Buddhas completely wake up from the sleep of confusion by getting rid of it entirely, they directly experience the dharmadhatu. Since none of the three parts exist for them, there can't be any consciousness without external objects.
Furthermore, from a buddha's perspective of seeing ultimate reality, these three do not appear. And from a buddha's perspective of seeing conventional reality, while nothing appears due to the buddha's own mind being affected by traces of ignorance, the buddha knows what appears to other beings whose minds are affected by ignorance through seeing how things appear to them.
Second point: Someone might object: "Even without external objects, consciousness must exist inherently because people with eye diseases perceive things like floating hairs that don't actually exist." But this argument doesn't work.
Why is this? When someone's eye has a visual disorder, and their mind sees hair-like shapes due to the power of that disorder, then from the perspective of that person's understanding, both the visual consciousness and the appearance of those hair-like shapes - the objects appearing as floating hairs - exist.
When someone with clear vision - eyes without any disease - looks at something, both the appearance of hair strands and the mind that sees them are false and unreal. This is because we can't be sure there's awareness without having something appearing as its object. We must definitely accept this point.
That's not correct. If someone with an eye disease sees floating hairs that aren't really there, and claims this perception is naturally real, then anyone else looking at the same spot should also see floating hairs, even without having the eye disease. Why? Because in both cases, there's no actual object there to see.
If something truly exists and arises from something else, it would have to arise from everything else. Similarly, if a truly existing consciousness arises, then in a situation where floating hairs don't actually exist for either person, it wouldn't make sense that someone with an eye disease sees them while someone without the eye disease doesn't. This is because if the consciousness were truly existing, it wouldn't need to depend on the eye disease, making the two completely unrelated.
Since people without eye disease don't experience perceptions of floating hairs appearing, there cannot be any consciousness that exists inherently without external objects.
The second section has three parts. First, it refutes the idea that our perceptions arise from ripened mental habits. Second, it refutes claims about consciousness existing without external objects. Third, it shows how rejecting the Mind-Only (Cittamātra) view doesn't contradict Buddhist scriptures. Let's look at the first part, which has two sections: presenting and then refuting the opponent's view. The opponent argues that if seeing things like floating hairs was caused by those things actually existing, then people with healthy eyes would see them too - but they don't. Instead, they say it's because of mental habits from previous experiences that have either ripened or not, which determine whether we perceive things or not. They claim only people with ripened mental impressions of seeing hairs will perceive them.
Someone might argue: "People with healthy eyes don't see floating hairs because they haven't developed the mental patterns that make the mind see floating hairs. So when people with healthy eyes don't perceive floating hairs, it's not because floating hairs don't exist as knowable objects - it's because their minds aren't conditioned to see them."
The second section has three parts: disproving that power exists inherently in the present, in the future, and in the past. For the first part: If there were something we call "power" that existed inherently, we might accept that consciousness could arise or not arise depending on whether this power ripens or not. However, since such an inherently existing power does not exist, this idea cannot be established.
How does this not work? When we look at this potential, is it connected to our present awareness, or does it connect to past and future awareness? Let's consider this: first, there can't be any inherent potential in what exists right now in the present moment. And there's definitely no potential in anything that hasn't happened yet - the future.
Regarding this philosophical point: if we say that potential exists within our present consciousness, then both consciousness and potential would have to exist at the same time. When we express the relationship between potential and its possessor using the possessive case (as in "consciousness of potential"), we must recognize that these two cannot be separate things. Therefore, it doesn't make sense for the consciousness of potential to exist as the potential itself. If it did exist that way, we would have an effect without any cause other than itself, just like saying a sprout could exist while its seed never disappears.
When we talk about potential and what has potential, using "consciousness from potential" as a fifth case relationship, it doesn't make sense to say that consciousness comes from a potential that exists at the same time - because that would mean the result exists at the same time as its cause. So, for now at least, we can say there's no potential causing present consciousness.
Regarding the second point: When we talk about potential existing in consciousness before it arises, the term "potential of consciousness" shows that potential is what's being described and consciousness is what describes it. In this case, we can't say that future consciousness that hasn't arisen yet "is consciousness" as a positive statement, nor can we say it "is not consciousness" as a naturally established negative statement.
When a future consciousness hasn't become present consciousness, there's no way to say "this potential belongs to this consciousness" - it's simply not possible.
Without a distinguishing consciousness, there can't be any capacity that depends on it. If this weren't true, we would have to accept the absurd idea that even a barren woman's son could have such a capacity.
If we think about consciousness arising from potential, saying "this is its potential and from this potential this consciousness will arise," we're making a distinction between subject and quality. It's like in everyday life when we say "cook the rice" or "weave cloth from this thread" - we're thinking about future rice and cloth. The Treasury also mentions three types of beings entering the womb, including universal monarchs and two self-arising ones. Similarly, when talking about consciousness's potential, we're thinking about future consciousness. But this argument fails. If something exists occasionally, its effect will appear later. But things that never arise - like a barren woman's son or unconditioned space - won't appear now or later. So even if we accept consciousness arising from inherent potential, since future consciousness never inherently exists, there's no potential to produce it. Like a barren woman's son, without inherent potential, no inherent consciousness can arise.
When the Madhyamika philosophers argue against the idea that sprouts come into being with their own inherent nature, they often make this point: If you say a sprout can appear even though it didn't exist when it was just a seed, then you might as well say rabbit horns could appear too! They make this extreme comparison to show that if something truly existed by its own nature, it couldn't exist at one time and not exist at another - it would have to either always exist or never exist at all. They're not trying to say that nothing can come from nothing - they're making a specific point about inherent existence. This same logic applies to things like cooked rice - if things had to exist inherently, then future things like cooked rice would have to be completely non-existent.
Furthermore, we say that a potential exists because there will be consciousness in the future, and we say consciousness exists because there is a potential for it to arise. This means they depend on each other to exist. If you accept this, then as the noble ones with supreme wisdom have taught, consciousness cannot have any inherent existence of its own.
The commentary explains that things like "long and short" or "near and far" exist as mere labels, but don't have natural existence. We should understand that this doesn't deny their existence completely - it only denies their inherent existence. If someone speaks this way, they are following our approach. Therefore, consciousness has no power over future things.
Third, let's look at why past consciousness has no inherent power. If a consciousness that's in the process of ending leaves behind a special potential as a tendency in the foundation consciousness to produce a similar future result, and if a future consciousness then comes from this potential of the ceased consciousness when it ripens, this would mean that a different result-consciousness would come from the potential of something that's inherently different. Why? Because in your view, when moments occur in sequence as part of a continuum, each earlier and later moment is inherently different from the others.
The word for "continuum" comes from a root meaning "to expand." When we add a grammatical ending to this root, it gives us the meaning of "transmission" or "continuous flow." Think of it like a river - just as water flows continuously, causes and effects follow each other without gaps. This is how birth and death work too - there are no empty spaces between them. We're talking about conditioned things that exist as moments spanning past, present, and future. These moments aren't just a sequence of disconnected instants - they're parts of a whole. The individual moments are parts of the continuum, so we call them "possessors of continuum." The continuum itself is like a container that holds all these parts together - just like a pot contains its lip, neck, and other parts.
Earlier and later moments are different and distinct from each other. The opponent accepts that they are different because they are established by their own characteristics. Therefore, something arises from the power of another thing that is established by its own nature.
If you think there is no fault just because you want it that way, then everything would arise from everything else that is different from itself.
Even though moments that follow each other in sequence have different inherent natures, you might argue that their continuum remains the same - it's one continuous stream. Based on this, you might say there's no problem of everything potentially arising from everything else. This argument about sequential moments sharing one continuum is actually the main response trying to avoid the absurd consequences of things arising from other things.
Even if we accept that having a single continuum between inherently separate things wouldn't be problematic, such a single continuum hasn't been proven yet and needs to be demonstrated. Why? Because it doesn't make sense to have an unbroken continuum between things that are inherently different from each other across time. For example, just as <Maitreya> and <Upagupta> are different people and can't share a single continuum, similarly things that are inherently separate at different times can't reasonably share one continuum. This addresses the extreme consequence argument against other-arising.
When someone argues that rice seeds and sprouts share the same continuum while barley sprouts don't share that continuum with rice seeds (so not everything comes from everything), they can't escape a fundamental problem. The issue is that they're accepting things as inherently different from each other. <Candrakīrti> clearly shows this criticism isn't about mere difference between things, but about believing things are inherently different. When people misunderstand this and make arguments about shared categories, ignoring <Candrakīrti's> actual explanation of why this defense fails, they're making up their own interpretations and damaging his perfect philosophical system.
The second part has two sections: explaining other people's views and refuting those views. For the first section: After explaining their position, the Cittamātra followers thought they could prove their point by mainly restating their own view. They said that when other types of consciousness cease, they immediately leave their imprints—which are potentials for producing eye consciousness—in the foundation consciousness. Later, when these imprints mature, they produce an eye consciousness that follows the pattern of the previous consciousness.
When our eye consciousness arises, it depends on an uninterrupted sequence of moments of potential. Due to ignorance, people in the world think this potential is a physical eye organ. However, there is no eye faculty that exists separately from consciousness. This same principle applies to all other physical sense faculties.
Regarding this topic, when eye consciousness arises, its underlying tendencies serve as the causal condition, while the eye faculty acts as its dominant condition.
Here, when we teach that the eye faculty directly causes visual consciousness, we're talking about when the tendencies for visual consciousness have ripened, not just any eye faculty.
The text "Middle and Extremes" explains that our consciousness creates appearances of objects, living beings, and self, but these objects don't really exist. Master Sthiramati explained that this refers to how the foundation consciousness creates appearances of physical sense organs like our eyes. This is why the Mind-Only school, which accepts foundation consciousness, believes that our physical senses are just appearances in the foundation consciousness.
After showing that our sense organs like eyes don't exist separately from consciousness, the text explains that physical forms also don't exist separately from consciousness. It states that in our world, the five types of consciousness that come from our five senses actually arise from seeds stored in our foundation consciousness, without any real external objects like blue things to grasp. These appearances of blue and other colors emerge when these seeds ripen. However, ordinary people don't understand this and mistakenly believe that what appears in their mind as blue and other colors are external objects they can grasp.
